0	i lived next door to a dope dealer who was a murderer, am i dead ? no !
1	He killed thousands of failed athletes? I must have missed this in the news.
2	got anything more than your opinion that proves scientifically that the athletes will be completely safe and breathing pristine air with the factories shut down 2 weeks before the games start, and only half the cars taken off the road each day? i mean, it took a decade or more before the la basin declared victory over the dangerous pollutants that prevented asthmatics from going outside on certain days after we attacked the same problem back in the 70s. so don't you think it's a tad naive to think everything will be honky dory after 2 short weeks with these limited actions? and don't forget the neighbors the link mentions and their unending pollutants that will continue to come in on those same winds.
3	confirming god is, at best, a one-on-one job....anyway. unless someone has personally experienced the things of god - how would one go about proving it? i know, i know...can't prove a negative....
4	that's one of the dumbest things i have ever heard. if these dummies don't have a problem with information increasing, but do have a problem with beneficial information increasing, don't you think there is a problem? you included. you don't have a problem with change, only good change bugs you. dumb!
5	yeah, archie, i don't know what i was thinking. how could i form an opinion on the deeds of you and easy after about 6 years of interacting with the two of you, and watching the abuse and vile you spew on everyone who doesn't agree with your hate filled rhetoric? sorry about that, i must have been thinking of two other ignorant, insulting xxxxxxxs.
6	Steeeeve?Do yourself a favor and stop fantasizing about my opinion, 'mmkay?I don't believe you are like that.This junk you do where you refuse to address what I DO say and make up strawman arguments gets you nowhere...I understand you're getting angry, but YOU are MAKING YOURSELF angry over a position I do not have...Let me repeat that. Hopefully it will sink in?YOU are MAKING YOURSELF angry over a position I do not have...With that said, I return you to your delusions...
7	emoticonXFrazzledTalk about a fast and loose accusation.WHAT DID HE ACTUALLY SAY???Cause Harry Hay is well known for his gay rights work.If Jennings did find something about the guy inspiring, it was probably his gay rights work.If I said that I thought Martin Luther King Jr was inspiring, would you automatically associate my praise with extramarital affairs?This is just stupid!
8	human is defined by whether or not you have a funeral, included in the census, and pay something to the state? a homeless illegal alien is screwed.
9	what about all of the school killings that have involved use of revolvers, shotguns, and ieds? what's your p***ing away excuse for instances like these? in reality school shootings are linked to them being target rich environments where nobody can mount any opposition to the deranged killer. it's like a wolf in the chicken coop.
10	absolute nonsense. nope, not at all. go read the relevant paper again. utter garbage. 'fittness'(sic), however you are defining that notion today, is a function of the relation of an organism with/to its own environment, but 'complexity', as any engineer or dictionary will tell you, is an intrinsic trait of whatever system has it; external environment be damned. so do you have a measure of complexity for a genome without reference to the external environment? really? what is that measure? you're entitled to your groundless opinion on anything, including parasites. yes i am, and i ought to be. i earned the right by doing original research on the topic of host-parasite relations as exlempified by chemical communications between them. did rather nice work at that. the core paper is still cited rather often even after 30 years.
11	and a few posts later you whined about ad homs. maybe you could support that? perhaps you would prove to us that we are truly vile, evil, callous, despicable people that deserve to burn in the firey depths of hell for the murders that each and every one of us has committed? or perhaps you wouldn't.
12	"A sex offender is always wicked and villainous? Geesh, not very forgiving. While I certainly agree many are, I have seen many who are not a threat to society.Those folks on ""To Catch A Predator"" are definitely a threat though."
13	Ah yes, your diversionary tactics. I am sure if I provided it, you would move the goal posts, or demand evidence that you know is not yet available.. So, since this thread is about Jesus, and if a 'historical' Jesus actually existed, where is your evidence besides religious articles, forgeries, and accounts taken from Christians?What?? No where to be found?? Gasp.
14	lol. says the one who did not even bother to open the specific post link.  huh. again, you don't care about evidence. i gave it to you and you said i never did despite the link to the specific post right there.  liar you call me? well, i guess it takes one to know one.  questionable. all that the author did was state that the evidence rejects yec. he does not argue for another form of creationism.  please stop trying to argue there is only one form of creationism.  my god you are dishonest. still avoiding why arch would replace yec with christanity eh?  apparently you think interchangeability means that the words mean two different things despite being used interchangeably as the same.
15	but the question is can you prove your belief system is true? and all you've done is spew hate for religion but haven't even tried to actually answer the question. and ask yourself this. if the idea of god is such a man made plague, then god doesn't even exist right ? so if god doesn't exist then what has he done to you to make you so venomous and angry at him ? why would you be so angry at a non existent being ? i challenge you to come up with a rational answer.
16	since you are so oblivious to the truth, and probably flunked science a couple of times: http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/essays/courtenay1.htm http://newton.nap.edu/html/creationism/evidence.html http://www.thekeyboard.org.uk/the%20...g%20theory.htm http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/bigbang.htm fact listen: [ fkt ] n.  knowledge or information based on real occurrences: an account based on fact; a blur of fact and fancy.  a. something demonstrated to exist or known to have existed: genetic engineering is now a fact. that chaucer was a real person is an undisputed fact. see above. http://www.carm.org/abortion/embryo.htm a piece of my hair is of the homo sapein species too. does that mean my hair is a person? perhaps you need to get your 'facts' straight.
17	Reading Difficulties, huh?  There's a cure for that. It's called school. Perhaps you should go there.....
18	i would ask you for a link, but this time i'm not feeling generous.  didn't you know that there are about 2.5 million cases of gun self defence annually, in about 92% of those cases nobody was harmed? does this even compare to the microscopic 102,200 deaths (don't tell me that's, wrong thats the very number that your cult has been using, comrade) that the brady fanatics have been whining about? your stats are simply untrue.
19	Uhhhh, I just said that I DO JUDGE! So what in the hell are you talking about? You're not well. I didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. I disagree with your claims as I suspect would most historians. But it doesn't surprise me that Christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country.
20	only two choices? poor god, infinity reduced to black or white.
21	you really have no idea what a argument is? i do find it amusing you will lose every argument you get into with your significent other.
22	that is an utter contradiction. he knows what is going to happen, but wants to preserve our freedom of choice? what freedom? please, explain so i can understand, this 'freedom' which gives rise to only one possible future! the existence of a god who can see the future implies we have no choice in shaping our destiny. no ifs, buts or maybes. this isn't about god deciding our future, it's about whether we can. well, that's one interpretation. another would be 'not sticking our heads in the sand'.
23	"Interesting.... have you ever been to a schoolyard recently? I think the ""taunts"" are more directed at gays. Like ""f@ggot"" and ""fairy"". What taunts do you get on a daily basis? What... being called out on your negativity towards the rights of a minority? boo hoo."
24	and suddenly vor's list of incorrect statements has finished another lap around the universe! the area which was litterally saturated with cruise missiles was sparsely populated. the brass complained about 'hitting empty tents with multi-million dollar cruise missiles.'  suddenly you are concerned with killing innocent civilians? seriously, you have no problem when bush's policies gets a few thousand killed, but the instant clinton's massive cruise missile launch aganist terrorists kills one innocent, you're all over him. talk about massive hypocracy. you bitch about clinton not doing anything, then you bitch when his attacks on terrorism cause collateral.  seriously, get some therapy and some education.
25	yeah, like the guy running from classroom to classroom killing at will. you think banning guns will prevent criminals from getting them? i was going to say that you live in your own little world, but then i realized the sad reality was that you are in this world stealing my oxygen.  what? either try that again, or find someone who can translate. i kinda thought that the insecure, paranoid people were the ones who were afraid to step up and take responsibility for their own safety and security. i don't need to carry a gun, i could just roll over and die like so many others when faced with an assailant intent on killing me. i choose however to take responsibility for my safety and security, and as such, want to carry a gun. there is a difference.
26	Yep.We must obey the will of the people.The vote was totally fair!So...why are those who obviously voted for M.A. rioting?I guess they are like America.Vote for someone insane...and then riot about the results.
27	I still haven't seen an adequate rebuttal to this. Why can't people marry themselves if they are in love with themselves?  I must have missed your response.
28	Of course I can't. Can you guarantee that the apparent mugging about to happen isn't some poor slob about to ask directions? Big guy, dark parking lot, bang bang. Better safe than sorry, eh?
29	"And you're mentally disturbed. Didn't I say that there is no such thing as a ""ex-gay""??? Did I stutter?You can pretend that denial is a river over in Egypt. Somebody thinking that they can successfully ""supress"" their true orientation, and deny themselves homosexual contact, is delusional..because the truth will always come out..because that's what the truth does. Show me an ex-gay, and I'll show you a liar. Where are they, that I can query them? I'll wait."
30	"Some slightly earlier history shows that Clinton wasn't quite that worried about Bin Laden. In 1996, the CIA had Bin Laden pinpointed on a ranch in Afghanistan. It needed permission ONLY from the Clinton White House (not Congress) to vaporize it - it was in the middle of nowhere. An official from the ""United Arab Emirates"" was with him, that was Clinton's excuse for not doing it. What did he think they were doing, making cookies, or did it dawn on him that they may have been up to no good?Thanks a lot, William Jefferson Clinton!"
31	Sure keep thinking that way and never mind the millions he put in his pocket. How was someone else put it? A thimble size brain case almost empty.
32	i know i'm presenting facts to archie, sorry... archie, in point of fact you have it backwards. the theory of evolution was first, then abioegenesis. we know life exists. darwin, and others, explained how life changed from what it used to be to what it is now; they had no concern for where it came from in the first place, they simply knew that it came from somewhere. how did they know it came from somewhere? because there's life here now! the answer to the question of where it all started didn't get seriously studied until well after darwin. so no, the one does not pick up from the other, and the study of evolution does not in any way depend on abiogenesis. evolution doesn't care where life came from, only what happens to it once it's around.
33	studies from 1955, 1961, 1964? i believe that a lot has happened since those years.
34	howard -  who do you say jesus christ is? the long awaited jewish messiah? your resurrected savior for the remission of your sins? the great god and savior (2 peter 1:1)? simple yes's or no's will suffice. p.s. you can probably buy that book i recommended on your argument at amazon.com.
35	wrong again!! .. as was just politely pointed out to me a minuet ago it's about ' what does termination stop ' and my answer adresses this. it's a valid point .. focus on the life here first befor allowing more unwanted life to be come a part of the system.  have you adopted an unwanted child yet? if not i would submit you should focus you anti abortion energy on those kids first.
36	so you want to try it as a demonstration? i thought not. claims are easy to make but you have produced no evidence but words and only fiction to present.  yep, it is almost there per 100,000. meanwhile, your nation is rising by leaps and bounds and innocent people are being convicted to protect criminals. even dan rather commented on u.k. crime being much worse than any place in america. there is a reason for that....
37	i have never heard a conservative who was pro gay let alone pro same sex marriage. do you know of any? there is an old term that seems to apply 'if the shoe fits'. please i would like to know who these conservatives are that want gay people to be able to legally marry. who are they? since as you say i speak in generalities then you should have no problem listing these pro gay or por gay marriage conservatives. just because someone believes that the government should not be in the marriage busisness, as a libertarian, doesn't mean they support gay marriage.
38	i don't want or not want to call this 'frame of refference' *thing* anything i'm just trying to work out what you consider it is. tell me what it is. tell me what it's capabilities are. if it is abstract in nature what is it's actual worth as a concept. whatever that is... this *something*? you aren't your body as i've shown but because your body generates your mind it, that which affects the body can effect the mind which i can only imagine is part of this 'frame of refference' *thing*. or, in reality, 'i', 'you' and 'me' is an illusion and doesn't actually exist.
39	look around, the greatest majority of gun-related violence occurs were people aren't allowed to be armed, or have to go through great leaps and bounds to qualify for being armed. this is because the criminals who get their guns illegally and plans to use them to harm others know that their chances of encountering an armed victim are next to nothing, putting them in an near-absolute position of authority where they can do whatever they want. and the point is what exactly in this statement? last i checked thailand and israel were arming school teachers because too many students were either being held hostage or murdered. after the teachers became armed these rates dropped. why? because schools were no longer soft targets and threats could be met with deadly force immediately within a second's notice.
40	So you disagree with Zardoz then? True christians are those who profess faith and bear false witness? True christians are those who are ignorant, vain, boastful insulting liars?Interesting...
41	<Flush>Your own source said there's a cliff a mile and a half away, and I'm the liar? Go find it and jump off it, you flaming, incompetent, scatter-brained, dishonest cretin.
42	Whose culture are we talking about, here?I thought I was a member of the culture. What am I, chopped liver?
43	spoken like someone truly out of touch with reality. how long has it been since you were in high school? because if it hadn't been so long you'd know that short of coming to school in a banana suit (maybe not even then), kids could give two sh*ts about what other kids are wearing.
44	to review. we have this piece of wonderful news stating that we cannot keep illegal products out of the country, and we should just give up and quit.    major panel: drug war failed; legalize marijuana  new jobs program by sinjin for the mexican drug cartels. inport illegal guns in too.    and this news from a country much like ours.   australia. with much much more gun control than you want at this particular moment, and they still have the illegal gun problem.  and yet you still insist on laying this off on our constitution? the probability of success is zero, and you know it! so what is your real reason for burdening the constitution? ooooo! ooooo! i know! you dont like it!  isnt that what you told charlie?
45	lol just can't keep a good thing down can you gans? i love how it is only you and archie who have flocked to the thread in utter dismay... i'm sure easy will be right behind carrying a crucifix to ward off the 'gay'..... and no i do not think it will be overturned and i am ecstatic that marriage equality has extended to our nations capitol. let freedom ring baby!!!!
46	'would the french accept people singing the la marseillaise in english as a sign of french patriotism? of course not,' there are so many flaws in this comparison it is unbelievable. firstly, there are virtually no french citizens for whom english is their first language. second, english isn't the national language of the us, nor is it a language that evolved there. a better comparison would be la marseillaise translated into bretagne, or translating 'oh canada' into french.
47	about as much 'soverienty' legitimation as hitler had when he was butchering the jews. no cause? you forget about trying to murder bush #41. no cause? you forget about him funding palestinian terrorists at $25k a pop. no cause? you forget about invading kuwait. no cause? he kicked out the u.n. inspectors. no cause? he fired at our airplanes who patrolled the no-fly zones. no cause? the mass graves and stalinist government? and these are just the things we know for certain.
48	what is this fsm? if it follows what god says, then it would be a suitable compromize, but i've never heard of this fsm.
49	And if there are two competing hypotheses that are actually hard to choose between? As they get closer, it becomes less possible to choose by instinct or testing. A principle comes in handy.
50	Because they couldn't own models like the AR-15 or AK-47? Last I checked those were banned in Chicago and much of Illinois, limiting people to mainly deer rifles.
51	okay, my computer is too slow to go search some statistics and copy the url to try and defend my opinion; but, here is my opinion anyway. one reason there are so many crimes against women, or crimes in general, is that offenders are repeat offenders much of the time. how many times have you heard of a child molester being released from prison and repeating the crime? there is not much determent to crime when criminals are put in jail for a year and on their first parole hearing are released back on the street to repeat offenses. i don't know what the answer is --but i think that is the reason there are so many crimes, especially sex crimes.
52	'Most Biblical scholars'? If you mean they think the letters are forgeries and weren't at least dictated by Paul, then it's just not true that most Biblical scholars think that. I agree in terms of the idea that Paul in some cases had someone else actually put the words on paper and he told them what to write, but that's pretty irrelevant here, IMO.
53	Umm.. again they are identified as Messianic Jewish. Google 'Messianic Jewish' if you care, thousands of hits. So you now try to personally misidentify this 'Jewish' group on your own terms? A Messianic Jew is a Jewish person who believes that Yeshua (Jesus) is their Messiah. Some people (You) think that a Jewish person who believes in Jesus is no longer a Jew. But what could possibly be more Jewish than believing in the Jewish Messiah, Yeshua? But anyway, that is NOT the point, the point is the same as I made before: The fact that there are Messianic Jews shows exactly what I was outlining in the top post. You seem to be inferring that I am suggesting that such 'change' means a change for ALL Jews, sic, obviously I am not suggesting that.
54	Use some basic comprehension indeed. How do you think Dohzhansky 'produced' assortative mating? It was by letting the laboratory population go on interbreeding for enough generations - exactly as happens when assortative mating occurs within or between natural populations. What, did you imagine he operated on them, or something? Geeeeez..
55	we could make this a little contest i suppose and see who gets the most right. for the primary categories anyway. picture, acting, directing, writing, any others? also definitely say what you think will, and what you think should.
56	That's certainly an interesting point. I know next to nothing about global economics, so I won't try to argue here. But I will make a guess that such a thing will never happen as long as we're still a superpower and cling to our beloved dollar. Probably we'll devolve into just four or five major currencies in the next 50 or so years and leave it at that for a long while.But to stay on topic, I'm just wondering why such a thing was brought up as a Sign of The End. Why would it seem evil to someone living back then? It's an oft-quoted religious statistic that always leaves me scratching my head.
57	i believe that evolution is a perfectly logical idea. (from the science point of view)all humans are traced to monkeys from africa. from there they spread throughout the world. if it is not evolution, then why do humans from high elevations have larger lungs? how come africans have a darker skin tone? how come humans from cold regions have a thicker coat of hair? i doubt it is coinsidental, and no offense, but i dont think that a god did this for us. every person has a subconscience. in this subconscience we think of lesser facts. does that mean that it is possible for the subconscience to create the genetic material used for reproduction a way to survive better? i believe so.
58	well, signorile certainly didn't back up his opinions in this instance. how do you know it's the truth? if it were definitive, i'd be more inclined to agree. it's not 'common knowledge' that merv griffin was gay, at least not outside of hollywood. i'd never heard it myself. i don't see how you could know for certain anyone was gay that was in the closet unless they admitted to it or were seen doing something that made it clear they were (like having sex with someone of the same gender).  and the idea he should be hold some responsibility for not talking to reagan about aids in the 80s is absolutely opinion.
59	'two other sacramento-area police officers also were implicated in illegal weapons sales but not charged because they didn't turn large profits,' ah it's ok to sell illegal weapons as long as you don't make a big profit?  'california law bars citizens from buying handguns that have not been deemed safe by the state department of justice, but the law exempts peace officers.' the cops there are above the law? had to put a new hard drive and install,good to be back.
60	"What exactly has bin Laden gained? The last I heard, some 75-80% of his top leadership is dead or in the slammer. With ""friends"" like Bush, who needs enemies? How would you like to be on the run or living in a hole for the rest of your natural days? That's the life that bin Laden lives today. He has to communicate to the outside world via courier and donkey. And tell me again, how bin Laden gains by killing Muslims? I don't quite get that part."
61	What good has come from religion? None that I can see.
62	"So the initial murder wasn't enough to show ""that they are willing to commit acts of violence""? This makes absolutely no sense."
63	ya know what? this has inspired me to make a thread, hold on a sec.
64	based on what? you admit there were 800,000 abortions performed in 1973 but yet if you dared to check the fertility rate between 1972 to 1973 it is nearly static; meaning there were just as many people giving birth before and after roe. surely, 800,000 potential births being aborted would have cut the fertility rate sharpely but it didn't.  you don't have to be a rocket-scientist to speculate what this means; that just as many women were having abortions between 1972 - 1973 and roe v wade only changed who was performing these abortions...not whether people were having them or not.
65	How does this have anything to do with marriage? Reproduction occurs outside of marriage and has done so long before man became civilized.   Permitting only gay marriages won't decrease numbers. Increased family planning and birth control will.
66	simple answer? dc has a lot less budget than the usa government. more complex answer? just looking at the commuters, there are over 400,000 people that come to work in dc every day (see link in my last post). making the preposterous assumption that they all come in at a constant flow, just looking at 400,000 of them and assuming that you would only check them coming in, that's ~4.6 people admitted per second for every second of the working week. good luck with that. good luck with convincing people that it's constitutional, as well - airports get away with it, but only because there is such a (largely unfounded) fear of death by terrorist that they can get away with something which is constitutionally shady. a quick search gave me two relevant results almost immediately.
67	this is getting mighty old trebor.  i'll take that last post as a tacit admission that you had, indeed, invented budge as a source. the question then becomes, where did you get these ideas from first time around, and why aren't you sharing them with us? why did you feel compelled to fib? this photo brings up a bunch of other questions. on what website did you just find that picture? how and why are you interpreting it as it you are?
68	so God would rather have evil in the world than infringe freedom. how very libertarian of you, jyoshu.but actually, are evil and freedom inversely proportionate? look at the examples i gave: slavery is both evil and an infringement on human freedom. on top of that, God puts evil into people and then does not take responsibility when these people do evil things... not to mention the evil that he himself has done. murder, genocide, bigotry... the lot.if he made people with complete freedom, he MUST have made people with evil as well. why did he do that? the only reason i can come up with is that if God made everyone in his image, he himself must be evil, even partially. that that is apparent in the bible.
69	and how do you know?? let's see evidence of this. or, it is just one of your proclamations?? that statement says to me 'i can close my eyes to all evidence, all common sense, because i believe in god'.
70	how? which does not change the fact that government theft is not.
71	prosecutors of every party under pressure to keep their conviction rate up? it's not an unreasonable argument to say it's better to make sure the criminal is put away than gamble on the risks in a trial of intimidated witnesses, forensic screw-ups etc. it's also not unreasonable to suggest that the harm done by making child abuse or rape victims give evidence in court outweigh that done by a small reduction in setence for the perpetrator.
72	I don't believe that Orthodox doctrine deals directly with WWII. I am unfamiliar with such. Are you saying that the event you stated had a direct bearing on the cause of the war?Our doctrine would deal with evil, in general. But there may be Orthodox writers who have commented on the war. We are a Church with doctrine, but it would take more than a number of writers commenting on something to make it a 'doctrine'.Armenia was the first nation on earth to adopt Christianity.
73	why do so many lifers just skip right past the pregnancy as if it has no impact? i am not talking about parenting. i don't advocate forcing anyone to parent. ever. that is why i support safe haven laws, signing away of parental rights, etc. i am talking about pregnancy. only a woman can be pregnant and should have the ultimate say in whether or not she is. it is her body, not your's, not the state's, not the church's, and not the fetus'.  when it comes to pregnancy - you wish only to legislate the bodies/reproductive organs of women. i bet you would not advocate chemical castration for any male who is not yet ready to be a parent.
74	but why should i care about their emotions? they obviously don't care about mine. this is in reference to the jonestown massacre, where this cult leader convinced his followers to drink a soft drink (i don't think it was actually kool-aid) laced with cyanide. okay.
75	The egyptians predicted his birth, death, WWI, WWII, and they have predict the supposed end of the world. Are you saying that this religion was wrong? They predicted a lot more that I have not put that have come true.
76	that seems to beg the question. be convinced one way or the other as much as you like, but if you can't prove your position, or even provide evidence for it, then how can you possibly use it to justify anything? yes, people's religious beliefs influence them. what shooter seems to be asking is if that's in any way reasonable? if you're basing your entire life on some point, should you be able to show that your beliefs about that point are true? put another way, it's kinda dumb to base major life decisions on a feeling, isn't it?
77	The point is that there are plenty of issues that go on in church meetings and denominational conventions that are areas of enormous disagreeement and struggle. It happens--it's not just this issue. You just don't hear about them because the press isn't interested in those issues.
78	wow, you're only 17? i definately had you in mid 30's maybe early 40's.
79	so do you think before you speak? abraham left mesopotamia, modern day iraq, for canaan to start a new religion. so where did he start the religion? canaan, modern day israel.  and yes i know that there is much more to the bible and my point was that you can't believe the bible 100 percent world for world or you would be contradicting yourself.
80	'diversionary tactic'? the topic was 4 july and independence day. out of curiosity, did gw sign the declaration of independence? was he the first president? he didn't lead a bunch of rebels and militia? i never said you were a socialist, that you were educated in socialist schools. the result is evident. you don't have the fortitude to go to nara and read the truth in our history archives yet you snipe around trying to change the subject which is independence day. if it happened once before in can be repeated not only here but in other countries as well...and it is!
81	well, since we are talking about a gay man, i would guess it would most likely be masculine. yeah, you are being kinda homophobic. why would you possibly care if a gay man sees you in the shower? they're not going to do anything to you. if you treat someone differently for no reason other then the fact that they're gay, that's homophobia. gays are just like everyone else, excpect they're sexually attracted to the same gender. their interests cover the same spectrum as yours, sex aside. they are just as likely to be masculine or feminine as a straight man. gays are, in everyway outside of sexual preference, just like straights. so while you can certainly be selective about who your friends are, if you write someone off just for being gay that would be a shame, and a sign of prejudice.
82	is this what jpsartre meant? at any rate, to say that there were large numbers of gay men, being infected in the u.s., is not saying there is a connection between aids or its spread and homosexuality in itself. there is a connection when there is active sexuality, gay or straight, and aids is a sexually transmitted disease. we actually don't know who patient zero was. what is the point of saying initially it affected much larger numbers of gay men, and fewer heterosexuals, to the best of our available knowledge? this is a disease, and unknowingly spreading it, no matter who you are, is not murder. the fact that much more transmission was initially occuring in a certain group, who had sex among that group, before that group knew it existed and what it was and how to prevent it; that would also not be murder.
83	good question.  let us say that dawkins is my teacher.  in the ben stien interview , dawkins said that evolution is fact, as much of a fact, as we can know anything to be a fact... ok?!?! dawkins also says that we do not know how life originates from inornanic, nonliving compounds and he says, that, he doesn't know and no one else does either. ok!!?! well i do not accept that as an explanation - so - i guess i am not blindly following this irrational line of logic. i would have to say that - i am not being 'indoctinated'. at the same time, dawkins has nothing to teach me so i guess i am not being 'educated' either. hmmm. i guess i would have to say that in this case i am - neither.
84	'if it's beside the point' the why bring it up, jyoshu. why 'talk out of both sides of your mouth'?  and your right wing talking points are stale and tired. comparing different civil rights movements is not 'piggybacking'. and incidentally, why is it that all of the blacks in congress for equal rights for glbt people? why is it that they are the most passionate defenders of glbt people? there are black gay people who suffered along with the straight black people. there are female gay people that suffered along with the women. on top of such discrimination, gay people may have had no family support. some were probably lobotomized against their wishes. some were raped, some were probably murdered by people they thought would understand what discrimination was all about. no, my friend. it is disingenuous to say with certainty that you know they have not.
85	How else should it be done? It is a constiturionally protected right. To eliminate that right, the constitutional protection must be removed first, is the removal itself, becomes unconstitutional.
86	[quote=jo bennett;314232]stabbing yourself is not ok, but that doesn't mean it should be illegal. i'm not even going to bother with your non-sequitor, but i imagine plenty of alcohol manufacturers enjoy the occasional drink. these are mostly caused by illegal guns. you can't outlaw something thats already illegal. i highly doubt this. how can a gun be illegal when it used to be legal? most illegal guns are bought off the black market.
87	hmmm, the employment, housing, and accommodation thing is really state based and for employment i am pretty sure every state doesn't allow you to ask about sexual orientation.  as for marriage...anyone is allowed to marry (so long as they are of age). you just have a problem with the definition of marriage. as for the military thing...seems like a complicated issue. where does a gay man shower for example? the womans bathroom? there own special bathroom? the mens bathroom? other issues involving relationships could arise as well. as for the adoption thing...only florida doesn't allow it outright.
88	how did you overcome all the similiarities? nothing was ripped and i stated your question and my response. originally i could have made it clearer, but you could have also used the scroll bar. responses to specifics within a post dont carry forward. you would have to be willing to accept that proof. if your not then it isn't possible to prove it to your satisfaction is it. read the source i posted earlier. maybe we should let the church go back to allowing only priests to have bibles and if that doesn't work kill some skeptics.  i don't suppose jews, hindus, muslims and bhuddists qualify as non-believers or were you being area specific?
89	I think that's a good question. I also wonder how long the medical establishment has had this rule? Since there must be some long-standing procedures in executions in the United States that require, by law, a doctor's supervision.
90	ephesians does indeed talk of salvation through faith created in christ jesus unto good works(2:10). i must admit that im not totally sure what this means, that faith leads to good works? id dispute that. whilst most of romans does talk of salvation through faith, romans 2:6 says however god will render to every man according to his deeds. in the end, the point is moot. i dont really care if the bible does say that man is justified by faith alone (and it doesnt conclusively), my point is that i am unwilling to worship a creature that justifies only by faith anyway.
91	what knowledge do you have concerning haliburton?  they are a conglomeration construction companies who, because of their qualifications, get overseas contracts. knowledge of codes and history of quality being factors. you seem to oppose their success. why?
92	truth can be found in god. we as humans have a relative idea of what truth is because everyone will not agree on what is truth and what is not. for instance, one might say that europe will regain world power or that america will remain the world power but if everyone doesn't believe it how true is it? but universal truth can be considered aboslute such as math. 1 + 1 is 2, 12 inches equal a foot, etc. the question will remain to be unanswered until god reveals what truth is.
93	mike, you seem to imply that the story in genesis is false (whether intentionally or not), yet you accept the rest of the bible as true in its entirety? what about the flood, the plagues, the exodus on a whole? what about the other miraculous and unscientifically supernatural phenomenon that the bible describes? do you believe that these events took place at all? the bible does not only oppose science's theories of universal origin, it also opposes a huge amount of natural laws of physics. would you say that the bible is true and the events in it really occured?
94	assumption of 'millions'. they must of because how else can we account for the species today ? got any support for this ? i can prove the antidiluvians knew about and used pi. if man began as an ape/animal then how do you explain the fact that pi was not discovered until thousands of years later ? ray m.
95	your argument is contradicting how can seeing people naked ifnringe on your personal thought and the other not? also the right isn't to marry whomever neterosexuals want. the limits apply to everyoen equally just people have different preferences.
96	I don't that it's selfish so much as self-interested. There is a difference. Most people want to live a long life. Is this selfish? The idea of an after life is merely an extension of this same idea.Why do you think belief in an afterlife leads to contempt for society?
97	like most things in christianity as the catholic church got organized. http://kevinantoine.com/holytrinity.htm now why does that matter? the burden of proof is yours to prove that god exists and the bible is his communication to man. you have made absolutely no progress towards that end. do not think my speculation on the evolution of the internal inconsistencies of christianity in any way substitutes for that responsibility.
98	let me guess - you also believe that moses wrote the torah, wherein he describes his own death and burial? 'wild theory'? i suggest you do an internet search on the synoptic problem and the related two-source theory.  why do you demand that which you know cannot be produced? no, we don't have the q source, but we have evidence which points to a q source. likewise, we have a great deal of evidence which suggests that the torah had multiple authors.
99	do you believe the average individual actually has any personal control over providing basic essentials and security? most individuals exist from proceeds of a 'job' or government programs and would be lost without one or the other, of which they generally have no actual influence.  i find it difficult to accept that the average, individual us citizen has the brain power to be concerned about anything but what's on tv. voter apathy of 25% or less participation in municipal elections are a strong indication of individual need to be manipulated as governing powers see fit.
100	are uk mortgages packaged and peddled as securities as in the us? if so, is that (those) a government or quasi-government agency(s)? i ask to see where the eventual fallout will take place. the uk is much like the us in that when consumers default there's always a substantial amount of private money waiting for those adjustments to buy at the bottom for future resale. if they are in fact packaged, the security holders will have to write down their investments and defaults by the end of their fiscal year, normally determining the length of that cycle. we follow many of your economic cycles but i've never watched your residential real estate market. brown would have a tough time pulling that one out of the fire.
101	we are not talking about genesis as a story are we? we are talking about bilbical creation. you really are thick arent you? i know there are religious people, deeply and otherwise who accept the story of genesis as a story but that has no relevance to the thread. undisputable is only stupid because you cant provide it. certainly not as comprehensively as the aristotlian view of the universe was disproved. the horse evolution thread was fine...you have showed a little horse turning into a big horse and not one species actually evolving into another distinct species but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. now show exactly how life originated and you're home and dry.
102	is two 'wrongs' more 'wrong' than one 'wrong'?  or perhaps, is two 'bads' more 'bad' than one 'bad'? i would say so.  but perhaps that`s just my utilitarian leanings talking.
103	Welcome back PeterV. We now have self defense laws from 3 different states posted in this thread. Is there one you approve of more than the others, or perhaps you have a different view altogether you would like to share with us? Please feel free to enter the discussion.
104	How the heck does darwinism get one out of poverty????I think you are generalizing by lumping ALL education into the specific areas that some religious conservatives oppose. If they opposed getting degrees, going to grad school, etc., I could see your point. But I don't know of any religious sect that opposes that.
105	What has this got to do with the non-material world, of which God and you and I are a part of? I know that the Apostles witnessed God's miracles. I too am witness to God's miracles. The evidence is adequate for me and for much of the world's population..
106	Do you? Care about gay people, that is. You keep imply that it's only their tactics you don't like, but I can't recall you ever saying that you support a persons right to be gay. So please, cards on the table. Do you support a person's right to have sex with whatever willing adult they choose? No politics, no tactics. Please, just answer that simple question.
107	you must be joking. i'm sure that making a gun is quite a bit more complicated than making a paper airplane. then why do nations which ban guns have a much lower gun crime rate than the us? if what you say is true then we would expect to see the same amount of gun crime in nations which ban guns as in the us, but we don't.
108	propaganda?!! dou you make me sick! how can you see these and still make a jeer at these photos. have you know heart for sacrifise of human life? have you no cause? have you no heart!? my heart wrenched when i saw those and it angers me to see one who has been deluded by his own proclamed righteousness to still be better than human decency.
109	why do you refuse to address the atf emails showing that they were building support for new authority to regulate and dictate firearms sales? they are truly right there, out in the open and viewable by literally everyone. why do you ignore them?
110	Why do you think they feel no emotion? All the women I know who have aborted did so under very difficult circumstances and it was horrible for them.Most women who seek abortion are not unfeeling sluts. They are real women, with real issues, and real circumstances that lead them to that choice. Want to help those babies? Address the issues the women face and don't demonize. No amount of legislation can make for succesful pregnancy without the support of the mother. Dismiss her and you will fail to do anything to help anyone.
111	...well...in the last decade or so we've been starving them to death. where have you been? the arguments are very similar if you consider a fetus to be a human being. i'll grant you that. in the case of your c-section question, i think the mother should have the section, but we can never compell her to do so. it would be too dangerous a precedent to contemplate.
112	if a frog had wings he wouldn't bump his butt when he jumped. based on results paul had more influence. how can you simply ignore the obvious? christianity has hurt itself over and over again because of it's unwillingness to concede that sometimes it's wrong. how long did it take the church to acknowledge the earth moves around the sun or that the earth wasn't flat.  instead they either ignore the issue, bury it through violence or intimidation, or come up with some ridiculous idea that is based on nothing to justify why they are right.
113	However, so much of the sex, in fact, most of the sex that happens, gay or straight, does not lead to reproduction. Why is there not the same aversion to oral sex, masturbation, condoms, dating, etc.? No one is saying people who do those things should have fewer rights, be excluded, or should not be equal, provided those people are not gay.
114	what makes you think they're not true? jesus arose from the dead. that's one of the most well attested to facts in ancient history, whether you want to casually sweep it under the rug or not.  many skeptics set out to prove the story of christ to be a fairy tale. none succeeded and a number became believers. you guys are playing with absolute fire. if you're wrong (and you are), you're screwed big time. big time and forever. do you feel lucky? well, do you?
115	well, i'm back from my rejuvenating outing. did i have any epiphanies, you ask?  what, one wonders, could the old masters have produced if their minds were unrestricted, their canvases allowed to contain any subject capable of being conceived, without the censorious church acting as final arbiter and judge? mankind could have had this centuries earlier to uplift us in troubling times, and ennoble us in our daily pursuits.
116	I saw that...was that all they had to say on the issue? I was looking for how they died...was in the doctor that did it or what? Aside from that...what is your point? I don't understand how this related to Planned Parenthood misleading people.
117	good questions. its not a condition, i don't agree.  jesus doesn't open the lock to the pearly-gates for some people, he is the gate. do you see what i mean? that's what he said, 'i am the way... no one comes to the father except through me'. i think its like saying you shouldn't put conditions on the way into a house, you should be able to walk in from any spot - and saying that having to go through the door is a condition. why would people not choose heaven? its a hard road.
118	Your partner wouldn't happen to be a guy, would he? As for your Christian friend, ask her to join the fray. I'd like to ask her a few questions, such as:Who do you say Jesus Christ is? If not Lord, God, Savior, and Jewish Messiah then she is on the wrong page.Ask her if people need Jesus Christ for redemption for their sins?Ask her if people should repent of their sins and turn from them?Ask her who the Holy Spirit is? If not God, then she's on the wrong page (note Acts 5).Ask her if the Bible doesn't say gay sex is a sin (Leviticus 18:22, Lev. 20:13, Romans 1:26-27; I Corinthians 6:9-10; Jude 7, etc.)? Those will do for starters.
119	does it really matter? the heller decision left the door wide open for most of the restrictions that brady campaign favors. why should this case be any different?
120	"Now you are confusing me. In a previous post, you wrote this: ""A gay couple has no more right to marry then two brothers""But now you say that you never said there ""is no right to same sex marriage."" So are you arguing that two brothers do have the right to marry? I am reading your posts, but you seem to make contradictory arguments. That may be because I just don't understand what you are writing.I thought you were arguing that there is no right of same-sex couples to marry but that they should be allowed to marry anyway. It sounded like a nuanced argument to me. But apparently that is not what you were saying? Can you clarify this?Thanks."
121	If Congress decides to remove the law, what can the military do?Nothing.Logically, they're not a barrier...
122	were they assigned the ultimate task of interpreting the constitution and determining which laws violate it? if not then their opinion doesn't matter.
123	that was a similar argument used for every single scientific discovery since the beginning of time. were is the biblical proof that god doesn't want cloning? those that said the earth was round instead of flat were labled heretics. many people believed flying should be left to the birds that god created. in fact, some faith's still believe that science is wrong, medicine is a sin. it is a good thing that we don't let religion dictate our science, or we'd still be thumping eachother with clubs and eating raw meat. pride caused the fall of the son of morning, not scientific discovery.
124	i see some names that don't seem to fit. c.s. lewis was a writer and scholar, you want to include tolkien too? aristotle was a prolific thinker but hardly conservative. it is as if you are trying to graft liberal (proper use of the word) philosophy on to traditionalism. you have rand, do you mean rand paul or ayn rand? quotes about the size of government from conservatives and founder types... it is the size of government that matters, not necessarily how it is financed. - dan mitchell senior fellow in political economy, the heritage foundation my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government. - jefferson government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil; in its worst state, an intolerable one. - thomas paine  what do you have to say about the 'proper' size of government?
125	So why should you care about their non-scientific beliefs in a debate on science? Most people who believe in evolution do so because of science, so their non-scientific beliefs are irrelevant.
126	Are those thousand people directly and immediately threatening to rape you, to kill you? Up close and personal? I will retain my right to self defense. I bet you would, too.
127	you're assuming a need to reduce it because government, or a special interest, requests it. if enough people want it reduced, their demands of manufacturers and buying habits will reduce it. deemed by whom? the government, or a special interest? who cares about the species? the majority of individuals, or the government, or a special interest? if the majority doesn't consider them problems, then no solutions are necessary.
128	i'm not playing word games. you said congress doesn't have the power to declare war; how else am i supposed to read that? you meant congress doesn't run the war...you clarified, end of story.
129	it's not a state's issue from a gay rights perspective, if the supreme court of the us rules that discrimination of same-sex couples is illegal in marriage, as it did for inter-racial couples. what would this proposed new contract that resembles marriage, be called? we already have such a contract. there's no need to totally re-invent the wheel at this particular time. foundit is correct. it's telling that this issue only comes up when people are looking for a way to not recognize gay couples in marriage.
130	You failed to answer a question. Have you had an abortion? I'm not arguing against abortion or for it, I'm arguing against your faulty premise that the abortion debate can't be related to slavery. Cite your source on that APA study. Because I found multiple sources that say while some women feel relieved, others have emotional problems. I would like to know whether these women had early or late-term abortions. Either way, I doubt the majority is relieved.
131	what extended family interference? even mass same-sex marriages can't get ss benefits. you should research joint tenants in common becasue that isn't true that isn't a gaornment decision. that is a business decision. businesses can decide to allow it if they want to, so marriage wouldn't change that. i'm saying what can't you do without it. not about marriages in mass. also the federal government wouldn't recognize it anyways because of defense of marriage act. so far you haven't named one yet. also as couples you don't have that right but individually you have the rights as any citizen.  calling me full of **** while i just showed you have you're wrong.. funny.
132	ridiculous. if ic cannot support id, id has absolutely nothing going for it, right? including their supporters of ic, since all of them with the exception of you use it to support id. behe is wrong, dembski is wrong, johnson is wrong, every id supporter is wrong for using ic, because freedom the great thinks it's wrong. daewoo: ic is irreducible complexity, the idea that complex biological systems like the eye or bacterial flagellum could not have evolved through a gradual process, but had to have been formed all at once, by a designer with a function in mind. id is intelligent design, creationism with new pseudo-scientific skin, a political ploy for creationism to gain scientific respect. it failed. michael behe is an advocate of id who came up with ic.
133	yet everything in that site is cited with sources such as cnn and what not. i understnad the florida right to life is not credible to our discussion(as they are not neutral) however the things they cite are...and that is what you should look at. so murder is a subjective term now...i laugh at that. your point was what again? they fact that vor didn't prove his case and never does? i don't understand....however, maybe if you looked at the sources on that site you would see that it is in the upper 90%s (however this is clinical abortions...not underground ones).
134	when did mike moore do that? how about in bowling for columbine when he portrayed chuck heston. here is the scene: 1) cut to heston wearing a dark suit. 2) cut to crying children outside columbine high school. 3) cut to heston saying 'from my cold dead hands.' case in point. both portions of the speech were not in dever nor were they about columbine. i got another quote from mike moore. 'fu** the poor' - mike moore. i put that together after a class in the mike moore school of movie editining 101.
135	Welcome back! Going to stick around for a while to debate the issues? I hope so. Let's see. How am I going to stop the employee. Hmmm...perhaps proper pre-employment screening, proper security screening for all airport employees as they come to work, random surveilance of airport employees, tougher penalties for those commiting such crimes...etc. There are many ways to do this. Remember that no security measures are perfect. We will never be safe, only safer.And what is your point about weapons/guns? I don't get it.
136	But it is OK to teach your religion in public school classrooms? Is that what you mean? What about my religion. Is it OK for me to teach it to your children against your will?
137	Did he say it should only be lowered for gay relationships? Probably not. Are there straight people who would advocate for changing the age of consent? Yes. There are different arguments for and against lowering the age of consent which have nothing to do with gay equality rights.
138	This is the most asinine argument yet. The man was making six figures as a radio talk show host. Why would he leave that job to hit the road for 18 hour days away from family merely in the hopes of hawking a few extra books? He had an ESTABLISHED platform to sell boks viz a viz his radio show, his frequent substitutions on other programs, and his status as a darling of the Tea Party. The man could line up paid speaking engagements to hawk his book. Why would he trade that for unpaid speaking engagements to hawk his book?
139	that is strange the last i read bin laden absolutely hates the regime in iran, mainly becasue iran is run by the shia and bin laden is a sunni.  so iran should be held accountable for actions of bin laden ? it seems like before(iraq) people are trying to conjure up links between the real terrorist threat(aq) and unrelated nation.
140	what does that have to do with the issue being discussed? unless you're suggesting that for gays to refer to themselves as ethmi did is an expression of self loathing. is that the point you're trying to make? beside, by presenting a film with dick gephart and gene robinson as examples of god fearing christians, you immediately expose yourself as someone who has no concept of what a true believer in christ is. so why should a film that is nothing more than secular humanist propaganda be taken seriously at all?
141	"Common sense? A collection of human cells as yet not developed enough to have even the potential for consciousness a human being? Uncommon sense IMO. Just the use of the term ""unborn"" is ridiculous. Are the rest of us the ""undead""?"
142	what is capitalism? can there be something like 'responsible capitalism' and, if so, what would 'responsible capitalism' be? my view is that the term 'capitalism' has a multitude of meanings dependent upon who is defining it and that 'capitalism' could have a multitude of modifiers to further refine its meaning. is to be a capitalist to be utterly free of responsibility and blame for the evils that capitalism may cause?
143	Well that is good that you recognize our society eats too much meat and too much protein. Now will you agree with me that you can get all the protein you need from whole wheat bread, oatmeal, beans, corn, peas, mushrooms, and broccoli? Now granted some vegetarians eat alot of junk food, and in that case they are NOT getting the right amount of protein. But many vegans like myself dont eat ANY junk food and follow the recommended food pyramid for vegans. I follow it very strictly and I know beyond any doubt that I am more healthy than the vast majority of Americans out there.
144	that's a real laugh, coming from someone with so little knowledge of the legal and justice systems as you. do you even know what goes into obtaining a search warrant? do you know what the limitations are regarding the scope of a search warrant and how it has to be narrowly tailored to something specific and nothing else? right. and it was ca law that lead to a father's children being murdered because he thought he was obligated to keep his guns locked up at all time, making them inaccessible even in a true life or death emergency. it was also california law that proved just how registration can, does and will, lead to confiscation. they proved our case for us and showed everyone that we weren't paranoid, and instead knew exactly what we were talking about.
145	probably because the article is irrelevant. either way, i posted an article to make you happy so quit compaining and just answer the question with some respect. thanks for just simply answering dog....i'm not sure why it is so complicated. if you don't ask race than how can you be prejudice? there is also no proof that people would currently be discriminated against. but current affirmative action is a topic for another thread.
146	why are these murders 'blatant racist killlings'? the article you posted makes it sound like a robbery gone bad.
147	i am quite the anti-hypocrisy advocate. as for my personal take, 17-year olds should not be taking pictures like that. do you disagree? prejean should not have lied about it. anything beyond that is pointing out hypocrisy. seeing some of hilton's work, i don't see why he should be in a position to judge anybody. i think the 'adds a little flavor to a dull contest that no one cares about' is exactly why he was chosen.
148	did prohibition of alcohol do any good? nope, just made the criminals all the more powerful. did prohibition of drugs do any good? nope, just made the criminal all the more powerful. will prohibition of legal firearms do any good? not a chance in hell. banning legal ownership has never, ever, ever done anything toward ending the illegal use of something. never has, never will. it's absolutely impossible and just shows far for withdrawn people are from the real world in their thinking.
149	We are on due process now? How can you evolve how you deal with due process? Due process simply means that processes which are required by law. The court evolved this into substantive due process which is changing the meaning of the constitution. Do you deny substantive due process?
150	never heard of it. tell me, what is the most troubling thing you have read in this bill so far? one thing i did not like was that it required me to buy insurance or pay a fine.
151	Another cheap attempt at diversion on your part? Once again, EZ, I'm not taking your diversionary bait. Instead, I suggest that you give some serious consideration to the nature of your sources. Doing so will save you a lot of humiliation.
152	it's a pretty obvious counter question, i'm surprised it caught him so off guard. what's his name, if you don't mind my asking? i've got friends in illinois who would appreciate knowing about this, if they're in his district.
153	Well for one thing religion is specificly mentioned in the constitution, not as 100% protected but in that gov't cannot mandate a religion. Also, religion is not unilateraly protected, as I've stated several times. There are many restrictions put on religion by government and if government can restrict religion then why not which marriages they recognise? That being said I have long been a supporter of limited gov't and believe that gov't has no business endorsing or giving advantages to any marriage. They should be silent on the subject.
154	yes, it happened through mutation. what do you mean by 'what sort'? i assume you're looking for something more in depth than 'the genetic sort'. i'm afraid i can't rattle off the difference in the sequences if that's what you want. if that's not what you want than you'll have to ask a more specific question.
155	proving my beliefs from the bible is not being un-christian. is it? as i said i don't want to debate it with you, i just like to know who i'm typing to. simple.
156	i simply quoted to you your own scripture, ez. how is that construed as bashing? de 21:20-21 and they shall say unto the elders of his city, this our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard. and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die:  mr 16:17-18 and these signs shall follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.
157	"So everyone thinks that ""evolutionists"" should seize power or something? If that is true, it is because evolution is very widely accepted."
158	does the military have a position on this or have any data to show it helps or hurts something? really that is what it should come down to.
159	so wouldn't that cover almost all of africa? there are so many people dying in the city streets of hunger in our own country, yet we elect a president who wants to address a problem in iraq rather than our own country? if we truly tried to help all those less fortunate than ourselves, we would be helping africa a lot more than we are now (their average life expectancy is like 30). yes iraq was terrible, but guess what, other countries might think our country is terrible. that is not our concern and at least we could wait until we fixed all of our own problems first. we have poor hungry starving people on the streets of the us and we go to another country to solve their problems?
160	this an example of what i am saying you choose to ignore the moral command from the ot to burn witches whereas in the middle ages that moral command was followed this passage also mentions that you must pay taxes as well, are you rebelling against god if you complain about the redistribution of wealth through taxation if it set by the governing authority ? i also believe that passage can cause all sorts of problems, for example a fascist regime is a governing authority should you submit to a government that is morally unjust ?  bad in general, and no i don't think the same. as i said i have started to modify my socialist principles, i have a great sympathy for the anarchist way of thinking. where the state is a way to oppress the masses.
161	So have you found figures pertaining to the rate of mountain growth? It is not enough to see with the naked eye the way erosion is. This explanation would also cause some mountains to fall as tectonic plates move away from eachother. Again after billions of years all rivers in existence would be deeper than those in the grand canyon without the material coming down from mountains.
162	"What is conveniently missing from your response? An explanation of why a limit on the number of guns that can be purchased during a certain time period is not a law which imposes ""conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms"" per Heller. If the punishment does not fit the crime it does not necessarily follow that the crime is Constitutionally protected. Executing someone for shoplifting would be unjustifiable. However, that does not mean that there is a Constitutional right to shoplift."
163	i think you may be very very suprised by roberts. i like some of the answers he is giving. i have a feeling you conservates may get f***cked. he is not as conservate as you think. besides even if he is conservate he certainly is not as conservate as the emoticonxcensored he is replacing.  as a citizen of virginia do you support this law that strips people of their wills and powers of attorny? http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp...41+ful+hb751s1 this is just a very mean law and will hurt many people.
164	no, i completely agree. it's frustrating from a woman's point of view also. does this mean that if a father and mother take their child out somewhere, it's solely the woman's responsibility to take care of the child? things should definitely be levelled when it comes to parenting.
165	Yes, but how do you legally get it into international waters? Once there, where do you go? There aren't too many ports where ordinance is allowed. Since I am a law abiding citizen, where, other than international waters, may I legally have a gun?
166	ah i see. so we take away the right of someone to do with their own body what they want to, unless they pay the government more money? sound a little too much like bribery to you too? and how would clamping down on hard drugs be a good thing? how about we concentrate on the real crimes in our society, and let people kill themselves/ruin their lives if they want to. why should i be spending tax dollars (ok, well hypothetically, pretend i pay taxes) to force someone else to not hurt themselves? sound a little counter-productive? and then we complain about a defecit? (obviously that's not the main culprit of spending, but you get the point).
167	any evidence for said 'abandonment'? also, the thing most likely to secure a lasting peace in israel-palestine is for the us to stop subsidising the oppression of the palestinian people. in any case, i thought we were talking about abm systems, i'm not aware of israel having such a system.
168	see there is such a thing as heterosexual privledge. some heterosexuals will do anything, or say anything to protect this privledge. for the christianist it is all about control, and money. the christianist will say anything or do anything to maintian their money and control. take own own archangel, for example, in everyone of his posts he extols his religious beliefs and his belief that everyone should be both hetero and his brand of christian. one must ask themselves; why does he peach against something that does not personally effect his life? i have come to the conclusion that he is afraid that he will loose his heterosexual privledge and his control as a christian.
169	Reread my argument, please. I don't see incest as good or anything. What I do see is that the only real rational argument against it is the genetic trouble with offspring (all other arguments are actually problems that cause incest, not consequences of incest). And here, I see hipocrisy. We're prohibiting incest, but are not instituting a global consistent policy that would apply to any and all parents where genetic risks exist. Adult heterosexual consenting non-related parents whose procreation is almost guaranteed to cause genetic defects? We leave it to them to decide and choose the preventive measures. Related? Prohibit regardless of chance. And really, I would actually fully support such a (yes, very invasive) globally consistent policy. The double standard annoys me, not that I advocate incest (something people here fail to acknowledge).
170	the simple and most usual one would be bluntly that marriage is and always has been between members of the opposite sex. there may possibly have been some strange aberrations in the past but essentially that has always been the bottom line even for homosexuals. in addition to those there will be those who oppose it on religious grounds. and why shouldn't they if they so wish ? marriage is an institution not a right. if you don't qualify then you don't enter. by all means campaign to have the rules changed but don't be surprised if they aren't.
171	So what are some examples of restrictive gun laws in South Africa? The people in South Africa think their gun laws are not strict enough.  In one of your previous posts you seem determined to use South Africa as evidence that outlawing guns doesn't work.
172	Really? Show me that by quoting where the article says it.
173	is the legal aspect of it disputed or only whether it is immoral? i may be tooting my own horn, but this thread discussed the moral aspects of abortion in general, and this was my contribution. is that sort of what you're looking for?
174	is this a case of the truth hurting? then i guess it would work both ways. how do you feel about 'christians' slagging off non-believers, declaring that they will end up in hell for denying god? conceited? yup. could i give a toss? nope. how do you think non-believers feel about the smugness of christians? and it's not just me who thinks they're fairytales and that christians are delusional, as you well know. so why personalise it? apart from that, a lot of us here have a thick skin. this is a debating forum, and there is little room for those with delicate sensibilities who feel insulted at the pov of others.
175	ok, great so far. we're getting some good predictions on both sides. i think this is going to be a lot of fun to look back at in time. keep it up. more topics... cap and trade. will strict controls be placed? what effects if so? iraq. will he pull out? what happens then? (with iraq or terror here or whatever) how much $$$ will he throw at the economic crisis? what will the outcome be? anything you all want to predict or comment on concerning the upcoming presidency will be appreciated. have fun!
176	so? anyone can be a victim of sociopaths, no matter what their version of the golden rule. making one vulnerable or not, it's still a 'nicer' form of the ethic. what makes 'social cohesion' is peoples' desire for self-preservation, not compassion for others. that's not the golden rule, it's just the understanding that people are better off if they get along with others. it's sort of like the 'mutually-assured-destruction' doctrine of the cold war.
177	so who should make the choice in the scenario you propose? for me, it must always and forever be the woman. btw, why is it in your example that the man is not the one who refused to use birth control? in any case, i do not want the nanny state involved in the most intimate choice a woman will ever have to make. btw, who is simone?
178	now lets add one more wrench into the anti-gun works! when the american people read, 90% of weapons come from the u.s. they are led to think, bought in an american gun store.  something even sinjin apparently believes as well. however, doing some research, i found this april 19, 2005 report that tells how u.s. weapons can end up in mexico and be things that the citizen cannot buy in a gun store. why? because they came from the u.s. government, dea and the cia. military grade weapons. now how many can be traced back to legally purchased u.s. weapons?    central america: the farc, the contras and the flow of weapons  america! get the picture now?
179	becasue tehre is no merit to the behavior that would need special recognition. should people with attachment disorders be allowed to be polygamists? what is so special about homosexuality that it deserves to be treated different than other behaviors? remember there is no definitve evidence that it is genetic.
180	What kind of quality? How about speed?Free but slow and crappy healthcare is not acceptable and I'd vote a solid no.
181	How long has the boyfriend been 16? Is he closer to 15 or 17?How long has nocturnal09 been 14? Is she closer to 13 or 15?If nocturnal09 will be 15 in a couple of days or so and the boyfriend just turned 16 about a month ago, then the 14 vs 16 thing isn't really the biggest deal. Depending on when their b-days fall, they could both be in the same graduating class. He could have been born in May 1990 while she was born in July 1991. Therefor, he is 16 but she will still be 14 for at least another half of a month. Now, none of this information was given. All I'm saying is that the 2 year gap (until more info is given there) can not be considered the biggest problem.
182	It's a lot more than what you've come up with. What evidence do you have that indicates the Iraq population wasn't heavily armed? As for the Taliban, you're confusing Afghanistan with Iraq.
183	Right so...1) God will kill you before he gives you a chance to repent? Thus sending you straight to hell. I like that!2) God seems to make life unfair for most everyone. Hey, even in America. Consider in America, and extrememly religious state, you still have the highest homocide rates out of ALL the western countries. (I'm pretty sure of this.)3) Left behind? So, wait. The riegtous go the heaven, and everyone else remains leading a normal, religion free life on earth? Hmmm...4) Hebrews?5) Can it help? The gospels tell a story about a carpenter who lived 2000 years ago, and may or may not have been the son of god. Yeah, I can see how that can help. Why can't I worship the Flying Spaghetti Monster?
184	my question is: who's funding this?  no sane investor would give him the money needed to run such a operation especially in israel.
185	i asked on another thread, but it fits here as well... is there a distinction between the absence of belief in x and the belief in the absence of x? before, i suggested that i couldn't see a distinction, but after pondering it for awhile, i believe there is a distinction between the two: if one asserts that there is no god (or gods), this is a belief in the absence of god. if one makes no assertions one way or another (even internally), then this would be an absence of belief. i'm not certain into which 'side' atheism would fall, though i believe it would have to be the former, and therefore, a belief. the latter sounds more like agnosticism to me. but perhaps someone else can better clarify this topic.
186	no your question isn't about 'right to life', but more appropriate your questioned should be 'do they have a right to continue life'? and my answer is absolutely yes!  at the living single cell, when the unique properties of a complete human being is created, it is living, not dead. who has a right to kill another human being's living existance? no one has that right in a civil society, but we haven't reached that society yet, but one day maybe.
187	isly, where are those who hate all christians that are members of congregations led by those radical preachers that abhor homosexualality?  where are all those puported 'christians' who have been misled by radical preachers into hating homosexuals? the country has far more to fear from them than it does from a black preacher who dares to speak truth to power.
188	why do you assume the poster didn't use birth control? they said nothing about birth control; only a statement on being pregnant and having an abortion. also, why do you make any assumptions about suffering? according to the poster, suffering was avoided. condoms are not 100% effective. a childhood friend's younger sibling was the product of a failed condom, among other factors. nine months and nine weeks are completely different.
189	Hello, ungerdunn.Hmm. It is possible that I will be living in Oklahoma in 2006. How easy is it to get to Houston from there?I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Tanzania. One of my biggest regrests is that I never made it to Olduvai Gorge. It would have been interesting to pay a visit to the ancestral homeland!
190	persecution on political grounds? we are talking about a kingpin of russian organized crime here. he has been indicted in russia for fraud and political corruption (bribing politicians) and there is absolutly no question that he is guilty as sin. now he is hiding in britain and actively planning a violent coup in order to overthrow the elected government...and he lays all this out to a british newspaper.  political persecution if he returns? probably not. execution for treason? that one seems more likely.  in the extradition rhetoric arena, the russians are looking a lot more reasonable then the british.
191	this i do not agree with. i cannot see how the court could rule in favor of doma based on 14th amendment protections. as far as the law goes, the marriage license from couple a from state 1 is the same as the license from couple b from the same state. how could it be constitutional to refuse to recognize the marriage license from couple a, yet recognize the marriage license from couple b from the same state? that is unconstitutional.
192	So what if he dislikes science? If he believes something else, he has the right to believe that way. My problem here is that he shows more closed-mindedness to the viewpoints of others.
193	so you have no idea if any states removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement?  and i'll just answer your question then which was (as you restated) [does] anybody kn[o]w of a state that had removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement. that answer is, yes, i know of a state that hard removed interracial marriage laws without court involvement.  glad i could help.
194	there's a fair few problems with this. off the top of my head... what happens when the pregnancy is accidental, and neither the mother nor the father want a child? what consequences would there be for a mother who didn't want to give the name of the father? would there be any? why is only the father punished? having consensual sex is just that - consensual on the part of both people. if it isn't consensual, rape laws already cover it and if it is consensual and a pregnancy occurs, why punish only one of the consenting individuals? on a more fundamental level: what evidence do you have that having an abortion is 'a mortal sin'? why should the courts be concerned with preventing a religious concept?
195	well, the actual personality of the computer is in the hard drive. ram really isn't anything but a notebook, and the motherboard is more of a nervous system. so the processor and hardrive is the mind- the processor being the modivator, and the hard drive being the memory. if i were to take the intel p3 out and place an athlon xp 3000+ in it's place, would the computer be a different computer? no. it would be the same computer.
196	i'm sorry, but i find this completely ridiculous and unfounded. i can see (remotely) how abortion might be considered anti-woman (although it is of course anti-life before being anything else), but how has christianity directly sanctioned the questions of women's suffrage, spousal abuse, property ownership, social status, etc.? by the way, do you consider fundamentalists to be the best representatives of a religion? i am catholic, and i believe i understand the dogmas and principles of my faith quite enougth to say that nothing of what you have mentioned (except abortion, because it has nothing to do with women's rights) are viewed positively by the catholic church, or ever have been. please explain with details.
197	How do you define evolution? If you don't see any, then you aren't using the definition used by evolutionary biologists. The question is who should define the vocabulary of evolutionary biologist, evolutionary biologists or creationists?
198	daniel dennett asks, how did just one species, homo sapiens, acquire the numinous perspective that can have such a profound influence on people's lives? he seems to think that religions evolved and originally served a 'primitive' philosophical intention - such as explaining the hidden 'causes' of natural events in pre-scientific societies. to give just one example: the rise and fall of the tides were observed, but not understood. so the phenomena were attributed to the power of a god (or gods) etc. i think this is a pretty commonplace answer, but not necessarily wrong.  why has religion survived the scepticism of the intellectual enlightenment and the rational attacks of science? the idea that some fundamental 'psychic need' in humanity is satisfied by having religious beliefs seems (to me) the most promising speculation.
199	why didn't you think of it? it took me no time at all to find the actual article, who authored it, and how to contact them. from what i have seen of your post, you rarely think at all.
200	Says who? People have the right to say anything they want to. There is NO right to not be judged by someone. It doesn't matter if something someone else does affects you and me or not. People can think whatever they want about other people. People can also SAY what they want. As far as a personal philosophy of behavior, I agree with you--what you're saying is a good rule to live by. But I can't agree people have no right to condemn or judge others.
201	really? congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; sounds like a requirement to be neutral to me. it could be rephrased: 'don't meddle with religion! do not regulate. neither promote nor inhibit.' why would anyone have a problem with this? and we both know that the limitation of government regulate of rights and liberties is read today, thanks to the 14th amendment, as applying to all legislative authorities in the us, not just congress. no state legislature can establish a state religion either.
202	What? Was she supposed to have him executed on sight or something? You have no proof that Palin condoned of this, or if she even heard it among the chatter for that matter.
203	but you have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage? i have shown that her definition infringes upon my religious freedom. if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way. would you care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way? it is her heterosexual privledge and her sence of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage.
204	On an internet forum why is that so important? The bigger man usually need not find it necessary to prove he is, but is secure in his knowledge he is or is big enough to realize when he isn't and adjust accordingly.My guess is this is not the only place this happens. These things happen, you fall, you get up, people laugh, you move on, you see someone fall you can laugh or help them up. Just depends on who you want to be.Sorry I am a sucker for empty milk crates. Can't seem to walk by one without jumping on and taking her for a spin.
205	They're going to say no? CA tried that. Tell me the last time utility costs were reduced by a state agency. It's a rubber stamp and nothing else. We travel in different investment circles. I don't know anyone putting their money in US long-term syndication on the equity side not associated with health care real property and a petrochemical plant can be a 40-year useful life situation. What's your take on the US economy in 5, 10 and 20+ years? Good enough to put up the money for what may well be surplus refining capacity before useful life term is reached? Enviros or not, if the return is there money always has its own way of doing things. Corporations are awash in cash. Liquidity has been the name of the game for some time, but there are always bridge buyers.
206	does the enormous pay of ceos help the economy? probably not. would prohibiting enormous pay of ceos (threatening to fine or imprison people if they violated an arbitrary cap on salaries) help the economy? certainly not. is rawls argument correct, and all that remains is for us to work out the details of a totalitarian state to enforce his ideals? no.
207	so lets ban cars... they kill people... and think all the money could go to public transportation. also we should ban baseball bats as thats the obvious next step in weaponry... don't forget archery... can't have the subjects have any of that... since we are taking away all these weapons to coddle the masses, will the government be disarming too? i see a need for both kinds of weapons as a freeman.
208	Why should every pro-lifer have to be an adoptive parent in order to have credibility?This is akin to saying that every pro-choicer should have to have an abortion -- or at least face that choice personally -- in order to be a credible pro-choicer.
209	Think about this? Do you support abolishing the Senate? In the Senate, a vote from Rhode Island is worth more than a vote from California.Also, the US is not a democracy. It is a republic. You are guaranteed an equal say in the House of Representatives.
210	I don't understand this business of the UK and England at all. It seems to me that somebody has a chip on their shoulder. Who cares? Chomsky is not as bad as the terrorists. That's an obvious fact. What is equally obvious is that he provides aid and comfort to the enemy and that's the definition of a traitor.
211	"The same could be said of Clinton.Tell me. How do people learn if you insist on covering up these situations?If a person like Sanford isn't exposed to his own medicine, how will he (or others) not recognize how it tastes?Furthermore, I find your perspective a little baffling.What he said ""many years ago""? Is that something he should be embarrassed of, because he was wrong?Or should he be embarrassed cause he got caught?Cause the standard of not cheating on your wife is not a bad standard. It's a good standard.We have too many politicians who look out for their own interests, and say things just for political gain not to take it seriously."
212	poverty may seem insurmountable today, but wouldn't water-born disease have seemed that way a century ago? yet we are not many years away from everyone in the world having access to clean water and sanitation.
213	Making up numbers again georged? Care to post some links to this data?In 2005 Israel received 2.5 billion, most of it being foreign military financing...there is some more they get though so your 5 billion might be right. As for the 28 billion in 2002...I know that is wrong. I recall a 200 million dollar thing, but I don't know if it went through.The rest of your numbers are probably overstated as well....you have a bad habit of doing so.
214	who appointed you forum moderator? i just asked obvious child what he thought should be done with iran? i never claimed to have all the answers, but i do share my opinions like everyone else here does.  seig heil to you too!
215	So what is being monitored by the ribosome? Information. Material representations (amino acid sequence vs DNA sequence) of information. But, it does not only monitor it, it manipulates it as a means to an end... fidelity.
216	"It's probably defensive to some extent on both sides. A lot of atheists I've run into seem to be out to prostlytize as well--they are basically evangelists for the atheist way of thinking. Religiously atheist, you might say. They're looking for opportunities to assert the atheist message. And I've read some pretty darn hateful things said about Christianity right here in these forums, and just chalking it up to be ""defending"" or ""kicking back"" doesn't really fly. Who knows who threw the first punch? It's to the point that it doesn't really matter anymore, because both sides should be showing respect."
217	don't you see the foolishness of that based on your own personal life experiences as a sentient human being? no. you were the one who posted that something does not need to be sentient in order to be alive. why, then, do you distinguish between two things that are obviously both alive, both of which are parasites on their hosts?
218	i've spoken favorably of religious believers who stand up for gay rights against a tyrannical version of christianity. what more do you want? blood? look, i disagree with the entire concept of religion. my view is that when religious believers support something that's right, they do it despite their religion, because it makes sense to them on the basis of humanitarian instincts, not religious ones. maybe sometimes their religion coincides with humanitarianism. all i can say to that is i wish it would do it more often than it does in practice!
219	now you are just playing games. you claimed the institution isn't being harmed. i said it really is--what else would you call it if the instution as we know would be done away with? the evidence is that if the institution as we know it is done away with for something else, it will no be there anymore. that's how it's harmed. if marriage is opened up to change everytime a group with a different sort of relationship comes along wanting it to be redefined, it would become something much more open-ended, broadened to meaninglessness. if that's not damage to an institution, i don't know what is.
220	should we clear up what we're talking about at all? i think adultery is legal in 24 states, and i'm pretty sure adultery laws have been pretty much completely unenforced since world war ii. i don't know of any states where a polygamous relationship with no marriage involved is illegal. now, certainly having multiple marriage licenses is illegal...
221	Do you have any evidence for that? And still, I don't know what you mean by kind.
222	Well, you didn't have my experiences, now did you? Each woman who has an abortion coul have innumerous circumstances and experiences.
223	"How about the individual's offspring? Is a ""subtract 10 years"" gene encoded in the genome just because of one marriage?Still no evidence."
224	"You benefit from all of these. They may not be direct benefits or even benefits you want but when it exists we all benefit. Frankly, the IRS is just an idiotic one. Your whole argument only works if you have the IRS to enforce these policies. Could we go without SS and Public education? Probably, but I prefer a system where society decides on what is a ""public good"" and we go with that."
225	"Galatians 6:7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.The whole concept of ""reap what you sow"" is a CHRISTIAN concept.And now you're claiming it's flawed?While I feel the need to continually reiterate that what this guy did in harming others was WRONG (primarily to avoid the trolls from misrepresenting my point), the validity of the generic concept of ""reap what you sow"" is amazingly poignant.People typically don't just go nuts and harm people for no reason.Columbine saw the kids trying to harm other kids who harassed them.While some people may be jumping the gun in trying to assign ""sowing"", I am also amazed that others are so unwilling to inspect the question of whether or not the church involved truly did ""sow""..."
226	I agree. What is the point? Felons with firearms do not bother with CCW licenses.
227	listen if they can be nasty to me i can be equally nasty to them. what part of equailty do you not understand? equality one way or the other that is my over riding concern right and wrong are secondary.
228	scientists found out that brains that think differently also work differently? wow... i consider humans biological machines (with experience being the 'software'), so of course brains will be different. but i do not really agree with the 'conclusions' drawn. with the 'traits' shown.
229	Oooh, I see. Only some presidents get experience, eh? And you think that Bush learns from his mistakes?! He doesn't even admit he makes any!Let me guess, only Republican presidents learn from their first terms, don't they? Pfft.
230	so what you're saying is that you can't?  as a political move to satisfy the pro-life constituents that put them in office.
231	i just don't see that being a huge factor. it might help some, but if my goal was to improve foreign relations reigning in spending would not be the first approach i would take. can you expand on your reasoning? the start of that chain is belligerence, not out of control spending. seems to me that if you want to control spending you should work on foreign relations. that way you get into fewer wars, and when you must fight you have others helping and sharing the cost.
232	Why do conservatives support conservatives? Paul's theology found favor with the Christians that won amongst the early churches. Paul was not considered an Apostle by the original 11 and Barnabas. Luke doesn't have him meet a risen Jesus only Paul says he did. His first missionary trek was a failure and the next two he was not equal with Barnabas.But the Apostles did not teach the same as Paul, similiar but not the same.
233	What's your claim? That the seasonal molt of arctic foxes is evolution or that it is not? As usual, your responses show muddled thinking.
234	originally posted by easyrider  would they have died for a lie, if christ were not resurrected? not likely. like i said, i doubt that very much.
235	Yes, do you? It's in a country with no medical facilities, no sterile place to get it done. A country full of HIV and AIDS. I wouldn't be surprised if these mothers had HIV/AIDS and knew they'd leave their child an orphan.
236	Gun hater pilot's gun control laws failed the law abiding citizens at columbine!Who should be held accountable for this failure? Well, since the government passed the gun control laws that gun hater pilot wanted the government should be held responsible. That means the tax payer will pay for gun haters pilot gun free bs!Gun hater pilot wants to disarm the law abiding citizens so criminals like the ones at columbine can freely walk around and kill their victims!Gun hater pilot wants to disarm the law abiding citizens so criminals like the ones on 9/11 that used box cutters to take over airplanes crowed with people!
237	"Well, I am a parent too; three sons. So what is your point? You think I am incapable of reproducing? I have their birth certificates. emoticonXRolleyes ""Bible""??? I hold Robert A. Heinland in high regard too. And Ayn Rand. And James Mitchner. And William Shakespeare. And Isaac Asimov. So what is your point?So, I should also assume you have only had sex with the intention of producing a child; in the missionary position only?????????????"
238	well can you point to an instance, either in canada or the united kingdom, where the government mandated firearm registries have been instrumental in solving any number of vicious and felonious crimes? i'm not talking about catching people who let their registration lapse, or those who told their spouses about the location of their gun locker keys, i'm talking about serious crimes like murder and robbery and others. can you provide us with any evidence that would point to how the registries have helped solve any such happenings?
239	ooo, the slippery slope argument! always a classic. the right to not be discriminated against based on her sexual orientation perhaps? what part of the dress code was she going to violate? she was going to wear formal wear. it's not like she was going to show up in ripped jeans and a slipknot t-shirt. rules designed to exclude her. their wishes don't supersede her rights.
240	"Maybe you are having trouble with the concept of ""low premium, high deductible"". That means the monthly payments (premiums) are low, and the deductible is higher (cost you actually pay for services). This shouldn't be a problem. How often do you actually use your health insurance? I use mine very rarely (not at all in the last year). It appears that what Bush is trying to do is get insurance coverage to low income folks without a multi trillion dollar price tag (like kerrys plan carries). This isn't a bad thing, and I am not even a bush supporter."
241	What issues? You drivel on about breasts forming on lizards (even though the most primitive milk secretors we have today don't have anatomically distinct mammary glands, and the earliest mammals evolved from reptiles not remotely like lizards), then triumphantly crown your straw man with what you seem to think is a knock-down point about nerve connections.Yes, SS, the most primitive milk-secreting structures we know are modified sweat glands; your incredulity does not alter that fact one iota. And guess what? Sweat glands have nerve connections to the hypothalamus...
242	third degree? dono posted something that confused me, so i was asking for clarification. of what concern is it to anyone whether gay people marry? adopt? what concern is it of mine whether female infants have their vaginas sewn up, for that matter? why should anyone care whether women have abortions, as well? again, where is the line drawn between concern over an issue and obsession? yay for you? there were black people who thought slavery was just fine, too, so i see this as evidence of nothing more than your own muddy thinking.
243	If substantial shouldn't be a percentage, how should it be quantified? How would you determine whether or not their prop 8 efforts were a substantial portion of their activities? And yes, as the law is currently written, it does matter how large the church is. I would suggest that those that don't like it lobby to get it changed.
244	i see alot of links to videos on this thread? but here's one that grabs my attention. i'm sure that this will shed some light on the issue.
245	then what did you mention? compensation against stolen goods is insurance against theft.
246	i'd say out of the 6 billion people on earth at least 4 billion of them are richer right now than they would be had the economic systems never changed since the era of globalization began. i don't think the number is as small as 3 people. how doesn't it lead to stability. think china and their reform to capitalism and westernization. are them more of a threat to the world as a communist nation or as a globalized nation? it will be stabilizing to have them westernize. however, it isn't necessarily good. yeah i can see what you mean. the people are just about ready to burst because the us and canada depend so much on each other. nor did i. whew, we agree on something :) isn't that the truth.
247	how exactly is terrorism not a criminal act? i don't see what you're getting at.
248	"Here's a question; which one split from the other? Which one is the ""new"" being? None of them are. If I get a cake and slice into two exact pieces, which one is the ""new"" slice? They are both equally new."
249	surely, we can only 'guesstimate' how many living species have escaped our attention ? but how probable is it that only 1% of all the species that ever existed escaped extinction ?  i think your point about mass extinctions may be a key to what has puzzled me.
250	so you argue that for some women, abortion is the 'easy way out', and that those women choose to abort, take the easy way out as you say, for arbitrary reasons? could you please reiterate these reasons here (preferably in an enumerated list) and explain why they should be considered arbitrary? indeed. but we've established that supposing a higher profile in the media in no way entails an actual increase in incidents.  so i'll repeat the question, hearsay aside, upon what evidence do you base the assertion that more women are abandoning infants?
251	islam is no more built on hate, burder and death than christianity is. do i have to remind you of the inquisition, the holy land wars, the witch burnings, etc.? if you try to claim that what some islamic people have done represents the whole religion, then i can do the same with those things that i listed, only for the christian faith. and don't even get started again on satan being a fallen angel - yes, we know about your beliefs that angels do not have free will, and yet rebelled against god, so we don't need to go into any more of that garbage.
252	Actually, if you count the Kinsey 4,5, and 6's you get 18%. It's 10% for the 5s and 6s. That'd be the people that prefer the same sex over opposite for the most part. 2,3,and 4 would be those who are bi and lean slightly one way or the other. 0 and 1 are people who pretty much always choose opposite sex over same. 0 and 6 are very rare though. Anyway, 10% of people are a 5 or 6. About 3% are a full 6.Could Jesus have been asexual? In certain philosophies asexuality is considered a sign of enlightenment. For instance, after becoming enlightened, the Buddha rejected sexual desires.
253	So the stats come from John Lott.... Wasn't he the one who got caught making up statistics and impersonated a woman for three years to support the pro-gun cause?  http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/31/opinion/oe-wiener31 http://whoismaryrosh.com/  .
254	"YOU LIAR.You are distorting the truth the same way Moore did. The truth is the NRA event was planned 1 year before the killings in Littleton. The truth is the NRA rally was canceled excpet for the officers meetings which is required by LAW to NOT BE CANCELED. HESTON said ""FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS"" in North Carolina 1 year later.And what transcript are you talking about? The transcript is posted above. What big pro-gun rally are you talking about in Denver. Do you mean the one that NEVER happened?"
255	i am familiar with both men; and my posts sound very lockean, which if you really knew locke you would know is true. remember previously in this thread (that is, when you were travelling these parts as 'bhbcu64') where i said that there is no right to control one's body? or where i said there is no right to suicide? that is locke 101.
256	I got ya, but I still disagree. if free will doesnt exist, then why should I make an effort to do anything? if I am destined to be wealthy, then no matter how lazy I am today, I'll be wealthy sometime down the road. and if Im destined to poor, no amount of hard work and diligence on my part can change that. why wouldnt I just drift along life and allow destiny to take me where I will inevitably end up?
257	you choose to distort my post by your suggestion about a 'primitive land': i neither said nor intended to imply as much. try not to let your tendency towards political correctness seek hidden meanings in what are attempts a giving a balanced account of historical events. british imperialism happened: it was not a completely baleful phenomenon. it had some beneficial outcomes even if they were not intended. english happens to be the lingua franca of science, economics, etc. i don't know whether it's uniquely suited to it. do you ? it's obvious that other languages have an input: i'm not making a judgement about them.
258	how did you private insurer determine the coverage in your plan? do they ever make case-by-case determinations not to cover something? i strongly urge you not only to read the house bill and the upcoming senate bill, but also to read your own health insurance plan, in detail, fine print and all, as well as to look into their record of denying claims. it's one of those things that most people don't realize is a problem until it affects them directly, at which point it's too late.
259	walking-fish: has anyone ever observed two atoms combining to form a molecule? has anyone ever counted out 6.02 x 10^23 molecules to see if they really make up a mole? has anyone ever watched the earth for a year from outer space to see if it really does go around the sun? has anyone ever seen electrons in a copper wire when an eletric current is passed through it? all scientific disciplines are held together by theories which are inferences about things we cannot directly observe. what is it about science that you don't understand?
260	hold on there. have you read the amendment? if all of our legistlators passed laws based on single incidents, our nanny government would be exponentially more intrusive than it already is.  now i don't know this woman's story any more than you do. all you know is that at least one defense contractor has a clause in it's employee contract banning an employee from shoooting for the brass ring in a jury trial. it doesn't state that the rapists can't be prosecuted.
261	i have heard that you can easily find a marriage license copy online and without having to pay a fee. is this true? i would love to get a copy of my deceased parents' marriage license if i can. it would be a nice thing to frame and to keep on the wall to remember them by. so, can you find copies of marriage licenses online or is this just an urban myth?
262	didn't intend to, he was in fact an enlisted soldier in ww1. my implication was so what? he was far better known as a failed artist.
263	i think you're missing the point. why would you want to keep people under control? to prevent them from harming other people. the men who created the commandments and the bible i believe had good intentions. they wanted to give people a reason to live their lives well, and the bible was the best and most intelligent thinking of the time (not modern, ancient). it was a good idea, however people started looking past the 'love thy neighbor' stuff and started focusing on unimportant things like homosexuality and abortion. so, my question is why is homosexuality a sin?
264	"And what did I say?   I quoted the title of the video, said ""Enjoy"" and labeled the link ""link""  So how is saying ""enjoy"" and ""link"" which were MY words mockery? The only thing that suggests otherwise is the VIDEO's Title, which I did not create."
265	a lot of people are adopted... my science teacher was adopted. he had a successful military career that ended with him as a war planner helping to plan the gulf war... he had a successful chiropratic practice too. what you said is not so true. should he have been denied his life because of some emotional trama he might bave later in life? i don't think so.
266	Almost? Usually, that is true, and it involves selection between populations. However, there are often times when some of a population is better able to survive. Those times, selection occurs within a population.
267	why can't skeptics be reactionary? don't you know people who automatically distrust everything said by bush, or by liberals, or any group you like? why should skeptics be any more objective than the average population? some will be very objective, some will be very reactionary, most will fill in the spectrum in between. i belive that the majority are in the middle, you seem to be focusing on the reactionary end.
268	And who is the 'WE' that we trust? The scientists or the theologians, who disagree with each other?   I am curious for it on my own account.. and not willing just to accept someone's authority saying it happened one way or another.
269	why are you trying to turn this into a religious debate? no one said anything about finding jesus. all you have done is show your anti-god prejudice.
270	how so? i would think 'they shall surely be put to death' (as the av has it) is a commandment, and clearly addressed to the faithful. how can one pick and choose what to take as a commandment and what is god, for want of a better way of putting it, talking to himself!
271	so you get to whine and moan and complain (lie) that i didn't address your points, then when i challenge you to support your points against my counterarguments, you say that you don't need to. you're a hypocrite, archie.  ignore it? bhbcu64 made a valid point and made significant elaborations. the only responses we've seen are 'you're wrong' with no explanation, and two 'why does this follow?'s, apparently due to ignorance of that pesky little thing called law.
272	there is plenty of evidence on what kind of marriage the clintons have. i am not making this up out of whole cloth, i am referring to the jr. senator's own words in her memoir 'living history': hillary rodham clinton felt 'dumbfounded, heartbroken and outraged' when she learned of the affair and said that she could 'hardly breathe' when she learned the rumors of the affair were true. 'gulping for air, i started crying and yelling at him: 'what do you mean? why did you lie to me?' mrs clinton writes.  doesn't sound like such a swingin good time ey what? but don't take my word for it, go down to the library and read pg 502.  i stand by my previous thesis.
273	is that why when everyone turned their back to bush to cheer the couple, bush just sat there with his hands folded looking impatient? what was really sickening to me was when everyone put ink on their fingers. they totally cheapened the bravery of the iraqis. none of these pissants waited in line where they might be shot. they didn't walk home hoping no one would see the ink and kill them. and they certainly aren't in the middle of the war. it was truly sick for them to have that ink on their fingers.
274	of course i know that i could be wrong but i would have to be proven wrong through rational arguement, not just claims. have you ever stopped to think that perhaps you could be wrong? either way, we already discussed this issue of whether people can have opinions about abortion law. perhaps you are having a 'senior moment' and don't remember our discussion. i really don't feel like repeating this whole discussion all over again for your benefit. indeed, you do seem to repeat your questions quite often. if you don't like someone's answer, don't just repeat the question - address their answer. if you don't remember our discussion, it started pretty much around post #861. unless you have something new to say that we didn't already discuss, then i think we pretty much covered it and left it at a disagreement.
275	i assume you take the position life begins at conception and biological potential is sufficient to claim to be a human. then why do we stop at a fertilized egg? if you mean potential, is supposed to become, or posses the correct dna to one day be then birth control would fit under birth control as would masturbation for you abortion is the immoral act of killing a human being. if we say based on results then killing is killing. the reasons are irrelevant, there is no difference between abortion, capital punishment or self defense.  yes these are extreme, but its where your position leads. at some point we make a choice and say that goes to far, but then we are back at choice and what is to much for one and not enough for another.
276	where is here? you don't seem to want to display your location. we all know there's more than one way to become an american citizen. that said, as an american citizen, english is the native tongue. it's the primary language taught in american schools and it's how our government communicates with its citizenry. i'm not really interested in debating this topic with you, it probably should be a thread unto itself. i think dono was merely pointing out that if you want to make a 'snippy' reply, it carries more weight when correctly spelled.
277	here's the thing about stem cell research... how would stem cell research go against the christian faith. does it go against christ to heal the sick? medicnes could improve greatly with the use of stem cell research. i'll quicky mention 2 people (1 still alive and one dead) who could have (or could be) greatly healed with stem cell research. for one, christerpher reeves could have still been alive if stem cell research could have been done. michael j. fox (and others with parkingson's (sp?) disease) could be greatly helped with the use of stem cell research. oh, and one other thing. bush has no family values. not just tearing apart gay families but also straight families. he sends husbands/fathers, wives/mother's, sons and daughters over to fight a war that we have no business in being in anyway.
278	just a question, can someone show me where symbiote posted at all on the thread?  4forums.com political debates and polls - search results he's got 4 posts in the past day. none of which are about what cashburnrate/yankee fan/roesgen08 says they are.  sorry giantorio for cluttering the forum. and thanks cashburnrate/yankee fan/roesgen08, you just proved my point. when i prove you are wrong, you just change your argument and insult me for failing to prove your new argument you just created. you did this as yankee fan on lw. you did this here as cashburn. you're doing it again as roesgen08. same exact story.
279	most parents today don't buy their kids toy guns and certainly not realistic replicas. why don't you just stop defending unscrupulous merchants that sell dangerous toys in violation of federal law? cops are human, they make mistakes. easy for you, the armchair patriot, to criticize.
280	aren't gun shows rather controlled environments? i've heard weapons for sale are required to be unloaded and customers commonly have to pass through metal detectors and submit to a pat down.
281	yea...i'd say we're on a downhill slide. do you agree with talkorigins that most mutations (like 99%) lose information, lose specificity? mutations are destructive entities. they demolish and break down what was there. granted some of these may be beneficial but ulitmately the gene has lost information. and since selection works on the level of the whole organism, it cannot stop the loss of information on the molecular level. not only that, but natural selection has an i.q. of exactly zero -- as do random mutations -- so i believe the only way for the genome to go is downward. and if the only way for the genome to go is downward, then common sense says that neodarwinism is wrong. it's not just unlikely...it's not just improbably -- it's dead wrong and the whole hypothesis must be rejected.
282	in what passages does jesus refer to his junior partner? i'm not saying he did not, rather, i'm not recalling off the top of my head any specific mention of the holy ghost by jesus.
283	sure, no doubt. but, there are ways to be absolutely 100% sure that you don't get pregnant. the obvious way is not to have sex, but i know you won't settle for abstinance as an answer. that's way too religious for this site i suppose. obviously i cannot propose that no one have sex unless they want children. if someone doesn't want to ever have children and is willing to undergo an operation (abortion) to remove the possibility, why can they not simply have a different operation before practicing casual sex? this is true within marriage as well.
284	so?? it was still a speech made for the purpose of political support of gay marriage. yes, i watched it. agreed. it was for the purpose of appealing to emotion (to a political end). no, but my point is that neither does the sanitized 'norman rockwell' image that some gay-pride proponents want projected by linking to videos such as the one here. it might give the impression that gay pride is merely some 'family-friendly' movement without the reality of the very dark side to it.
285	which is pretty much normal for arch. do you think he realizes that many muslims in europe are cultural muslims? that many who emigrate to europe are quite disgusted with what they see back in their homelands? the rise of gay muslims in europe is quite interesting as to how they have fully adopted the views of their adopted european homeland and are afraid of returning to their original home countries. the notion that arch has that once a muslim always a crazy muslim is pretty nuts, but nothing but typical from a guy who thought that tv props are good evidence for 6,000 year old acts of creation.
286	You two are on the same side, you just don't know it yet. And you're both friends of mine so shake hands and make up willya? emoticonXHohoemoticonXGoodAnd yes's video IS very disturbing because it shows that in a time of natural catastrophe's or mass turmoil, our Government will confiscate guns from law abiding citizens. During the LA riots after the Rodney King verdict, the Gov't ordered all gun shops to lock down and to stop selling ammunition. So even law abiding citizens with legally registered weapons couldn't buy ammo to protect themselves.
287	how can god be there before time? you can't get before time, as the concept of before is irrelevant without time. even at the very beginnings of the universe time was not one of the curled up spatial dimensions.
288	pay attention. age of consent is still the topic and point. if teen pregnancy is reduced to statistically acceptable levels through education and contraception with medical risk being a negligible five-decimal point factor, that would position teen sex emotional distress as a good/bad societal interpretation designated by non-teens, would it not? which would negate chronological age of consent for legal sex to a non-status unless those non-teens making the laws had another agenda.
289	appears i hit a nerve? i don't know why you put in the 'personal baggage' line...but ok. as for you not using the word 'hatred'...i admit you didn't, i did. if you say you don't then i'll take your word for it but your posts on these forums seem to make me think otherwise.
290	Not needed? It is evolution. The collor of the moths is genetic - caused by 2 alleles of a single gene. The frequencies of those alleles were observed to change in the populations of moths over many generations. It is by definition, evolution.
291	I do appreciate your point while I disagree on principle. I guess it boils down to the fact that even if I believed in a God I couldn't accept that He would command us to suppress our true innate nature. Why would He makes us that way and then expect such a thing? Christians especially are indoctrinated from early on with the notion that that is exactly what God commands. To suppress a good many natural inclinations. To accept that we are sinful by nature and need to be punished, our nature brought to heel.
292	are you saying you only have a hard time having compassion for the gay victims of sexually transmitted illness? if, so that just shows your anti-gay prejudice. what difference does that make? everyone who has aids is a victim. in some communities and in other countries, the majority who have it are straight. against the victims from the largest social group of victims in each jurisdiction? this is nothing more than prejudice and destructive political agenda.  i would hope there are other, better, human instincts inside of you.
293	if you think marriage is sacred then why are you trying to change what it is? i can't say this enough times...marriage is a word that describes a union between man and women. no one created the word marriage and then decided what it would apply to. someone saw and event and gave this event a word...this would be marriage. this 'event' has been sacred since as long as we have records to show. and now, some wish to make it sacred for themselves while destroying the sacred institute that the majority of us wish to keep.
294	If that were true, why are there millions of miscarriages each year? I don't believe a word of it.
295	Why is saying that many things conflict with the well being of Society at large and bans them to the disappointment of those who endorse such activities. Consider rape, murder, incest and sodomy as good historical examples of such taboo activities, taken by you as an inditement of all gay people JSD ? You seem to take any moral stance or argument I make very personally, as if I'm accusing you of being those things. You work very hard to read into, demonize and condemn everything I say as if it is intended as a personal attack. You really need to work on that.
296	that is not much of an excuse to ignore 13 pages of archives from cbs is it? cbs news investigates - cbs news there are reports from every major newspaper that reported on the scandal...which all did, some more than others. poor excuse wanna try again? emoticonxgood something tells me you don't want brightbart and fox news, nor the l.a. times nor any source to report the truth, is that about it star gazer?
297	avoiding what question, penfold? emoticonxbanghead how is asking iangb to take it to the 'challenger's corner' an avoidance? i see it as a chance to amplify the discussion. at any rate, it's a lot easier to answer a question if you know what is being asked. so,... feel free to repeat the question that you are accusing me of trying to avoid.
298	fantasy,fairy tale, wild imagination, adsurd , silly , ridiculous,fabricated .unsupported by one single observation or experiment , unsubstantiated. i do agree we don't speak the same language. no one will explain to me how one steals public information, i am confused. how is work shady? how would you define shady as opposed to rather shady when it refers to work? i thought bookmaking etc. was shady but i am old fashioned i guess. please educate me. is this a meaningfull reprimand coming from someone who believes one can observe a mind? you still have refused to explain that and i was so anxious to hear it. please go on.
299	is homophobia an instinct? because i really have no clue where it came from...
300	that speaks a lot about you and shows other posters they shouldn't take what you say at face value. yes it does. if i go before congress and say 'being gay is a choice without a doubt made at age 11' and had no evidence than i should be laughed at. same thing as this woman. she makes a claim with no evidence and reason to lie. this makes you not credible.  than a legislative body? while probably true, this is sad because newspapers have none.
301	an innocent person can be convicted of a crime--i thought that was what the topic was about. just because they are convicted, doesn't mean they are 100% responsible, guilty, etc for that crime-but if they are convicted then in the eyes of the judicial system--they are guilty. that is why these innocent people are put in prison for 20 years--they are convicted of a crime. i was trying to say that with dna used in forensics, then maybe the dna study blood stain other than the victims might save a person from going to prison on circumstantial evidence. okay, everytime i make a post i get my arse jumped on--what is it with you people? like i said, if the person isn't convicted, then they will not be murdered in the electric chair, or by lethal injection.  comprende' ?
302	what about evolution has been observed?  i think it has been more theorized (if thats a word) then anything else. creating theories for theories and so on.
303	why? you seem to think you can come here and trash everyone else's religion and go on about how your religion is the 'true' religion and when someone else tries to tell how stupid your argument is, you tell them to stop making fun of it. and why do you care about how old people here are anyway?
304	the top 10% of people in this country pay 67% of the taxes. most of the money from the middle class? no, not at all.
305	"I argue against them with regards to whatever argument they muster. Do we have any of those on this message board? Because from what I can see, it's primarily the ""religious"" argument counter..."
306	by 'church' ... do you mean the group of people who are christian (ie. congregation) ? the institution of church? to orthodox, the church is a living earthly embodiment of jesus christ. the role of orthodox is to be like god... by following his example. we are called to return to him, but we are separated from him by sin. we are living icons of god.
307	And can you please tell me the difference between nonrandom variation and directed variation? I'd also like a link to verify what you say. Thank you. God Bless!
308	"It went out the window with the passage of the ""Partiot Act"".I said that I did not expect Robertson to be charged, did I not? However, I am not a lawyer nor that familar with the ""Patriot Act"". It is conceivable that he could be charged. I don't really know. But even if he COULD be charged, I certainly would not expect to see it."
309	based on what? i never said mr. horn did anything legally wrong. he was well within the rights of the state of texas. i never argued otherwise. that doesn't change the obvious fact that he intended to kill the two men, which is the topic of the discussion at hand.
310	No, not really. All that is different is the number of steps.  What is YOUR definition of 'macro-evoution'? Is it speciation? Or is it a brand new genus?  We have observed speciation, where new species happened.
311	arafat is not a worse leader than sharon... arafat steals millions in aid money that is suppose to go to the palestinians, which 80% of them are below the poverty line. arafat advocates people to xxxx themselves up so that they may kill as many jews as possible. he is the head-figure of many of these terrorist groups and pours millions of aid into them.  sharon is worse? not only has arafat contributed to many more than 1,000 israeli casualties, his 'intifada' has continued the cycle of violence and thus caused the death of more than 2,000 palestinians.
312	did he? what secular evidence do you have from before 70 c.e. that confirms his existance? what is the outside verification to the new testament?
313	i've been following the story here all afternoon bbs. i'm sorry that you're going through this, but what has scotland done to upset radical islam ? nothing that i know of. could it be they have declared war on the west in general and as a whole ? i mean, i have been told over and over again how these radical moslems are just confused souls and the real enemies we must fear are the radical conservative christians like me who actually pray for the unsaved. talk about scary people, huh ?
314	what did sanger say specifically that leads you to this conclusion? the preceding is from wikipedia. now, perchance, does 'cleaner' possibly mean having been exposed to enough medical information to be aware of veneral diseases so as to know how to avoid them? do you have an aversion to accurate information about stds being available?
315	then where do rights come from and how do you know they exist? i commented on the part i felt needed to be commented on.
316	and the other two...? 'political disorder and confusion' is not the same as personal 'disorder and confusion'.
317	race is the elephant in the room of american politics. segregation is not official, but who can deny that de facto segregation does not exist in the usa? blacks stick to blacks and whites to whites. do you see any blacks in the tea party meetings? how many blacks voted for jon mccain in the last presidential elections?
318	this is rather naive. who would willing condemn themselves to hell? many people commit sins regardless of the punishment. here's a little conversation to save time... i understand texas has the death penalty. are there any muders still going on? yes. why? who would condemn themselves to death? some people don't think they're going to get caught. they don't want to die themselves, but they just plain think what they do, they can get away with.
319	what do you find disrespectful about it? maybe it is 'disrespectful' but i sometimes that's not necessarily so bad. i don't think it rises to the level of being offensive.
320	what is the big deal here? so eharmony doesn't cater to gays. (there are also gay-only services out there that don't cater to straights.) if anyone doesn't like the service, they don't have to use it.
321	along with some others here, you have missed the point. i know we all have the ability to file extensions for various reasons. i don't really care how much money they have. more power to them for being filthy rich. a candidate for president is supposed to reveal his (and spouse's) tax returns. teresa has apparently asked for an extension just to have it revealed after the convention. why?  is there anything to hide that would hurt kerry's chances of even being nominated? this has nothing to do with the average citizen.
322	she is an attractive woman. what was she doing witha 14 yr old? she could probably walk into any local club or bar and pick up the man of her choosing.  does she have a specific thing for kids? will she do it again with another kid once this one grows up? if so she is a predetor. of coarse several hundred years ago kids of this age married and fornicated as part of everyday life. is our society that different than is was then?  i was a horn dog when i was 14. or at least wanted to be.
323	whether there's liberal parties in other countries is beside the point. there is no national 'liberal party' in the usa. if nato was suggesting the ny one, i hardly can be held responsible for not knowing 'their message'. i couldn't care less what it might be.  she said as much. let's see what happens next, shall we? i have a feeling she'll be amending the policy shortly.
324	And she was having unprotected sex? So she knew becoming pregnant was a possibility? Yeah, I could see that being condemned by pro-lifers.
325	correct. did you notice that in the scott peterson trial, the judge went around the law in deciding how he should be punished and who has rights? a clear sign of activism, yet none of the righties called him a activist judge even when what he did is by defintion activism. it's a sign they are hugely hypocritical.  vor's got a raging double standard if he calls some judges who do that activist and others who do the same, not.
326	the word touched me in a bad place... i think it was at summer camp or something... i'm still scarred.... no but seriously even i don't believe that... how exactly is word spiritual? is it intentional? based upon the interpretation an individual gets from it? seeing as how the history of the bible itself and it's original writings, many interpretations, denominations, and debates over itself is construed it can hardly be seen as itself being spiritual. is it possible that through god the manuscripts and texts stir inside a person a level of spirituality? yes. but when you go buy a bible at barnes and noble it certainly isn't glowing with the essence of god.... it's debated if even the ark of the covenant itself if it still exists has the essence of god to this day...
327	EZ, if the concept of Gay Jesus offends you, why do you bring up the subject incessantly? You're the only one who does this around here. Truly bizarre.For example...
328	if you check again you will find they do have self defense shootings in the list as well as accidents. the point is, as even you have now pointed out, the number is flawed. the source, vpc, knowingly used false data to further their claim. therefore eliminating any validity to their claim.  you and brady continue to trot out biased and inaccurate sources to back your arguement. you should stop, it does great harm to your credibility. wow, you really can leap tall mounds of logic in a single bound. what evidence do you have that any of these deaths would have been prevented by banning concealed carry? then also consider the lives saved by concealed carry, such as mine.
329	i totally agree. you never know what you might pick up. but he likes to eat hey? that's weird. but to each his own. i like to eat more normal food myself. but if you explore certain sides of someones personality, do you really learn anything? how do you know you just don't watch and then five minutest after you explore the personality, you forgot everything about that person. i mean, i don't know, but i have some trouble picking up on personalities right away of people i meet. has anyone ever tried spilling tuna on the floor on purpose? i'm just wondering because that would be weird.
330	To be honest...I don't know. But I do know that to argue something is false because the consequences are not desired is a logical fallacy (Appeal to Consequences).So is the argument I posted earlier (posted below for quick reference) true or false? And if false, why?A) Only science should be taught in science class (this is why creationism should not be taught in science class).B) Science is a collection of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed, identified, described, experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted.Conclusion: If A is true and B is valid then science class should only consist of testable theories which have been thoroughly observed, identified, described, experimentally investigated and remain unrefuted.
331	well, you ignored the part where i said 'voting'. but imo legislative solutions are part and parcel to popular appeal because legislators are voted in on that basis. any legislator claims to 'do what's right.' so elections tend to be popularity contests. and legislators tend to want to keep their constituents happy. oh and just to make sure you understand this kronos so as not to get off in the wrong direction, this is my opinion, just like everything else i've said. it is not a lie. how is that even relevant? i never claimed it was a first resort.
332	one idea per episode? there were always at least 4; one for each main character. and they always linked together perfectly. with the exception of a few episodes at the beginning and the last one, seinfeld was always gold.  the simpsons, on the other hand, has sucked for the last few years when they turned to the 'pick a celebrity guestspot' system.
333	i think that would probably create more problems than it would solve. how would we know? we don't punish. drunk drivers get off incredibly easy so much of the time. we have the weakest anti-drunk driving laws in the western world and we have the worst problem with drunk driving. coincidence? that's not all that far from what i've said. @joe- this is for a whole other discussion, but i think that the first step in aa is a big part of the reason of its low success rate. that's not too far from what i've said either.
334	what? i assume one is within one rights to be anti-gun. that's all.
335	up to a point, but ther are things some people would consider 'wrong' that others would not. for example, most muslims would consider drinking alcohol to be wrong, while most non-muslims would not. some people believe it is wrong to hit someone, whether or not they have hit you, others believe you have a right to retaliate. some believe that sex is a big deal and should be reserved only for marriage, others believe any activity between consenting adults is morally ok. all of these are moral issues. which view should schools teach? should they teach that killing people is wrong? how about stealing? should they put things in context, so that stealing is only wrong in a society that recognises personal property. should they conflate morality with law? that opens yet another can of worms.
336	which one is this brady? the discredited kellerman study by the discredited kellerman? or the opinion piece of the rabidly anti-gun brady campaign? cite your sources. and answer the damn question already. is self-defense with a firearm an immoral act? it's not rocket science, there's only two answers; yes or no.
337	please clarify what you're saying here as it makes no sense to me. what point are you trying to make ? off the top though, any comparison you make with being black and homosexuality is false because the bible doesn't condemn being black but it does condemn the homosexual act/lifestyle. and who does the anti-defamation league promote hating ? i am unaware of it if they do it.
338	what specifically did he say to lead you to those conclusions? i don't know what speech you heard, but i have heard romney's religion speech as well as read it, and i see nothing there that declares war on secularism, or intimated that it's only believers who offer anything of worth, or that separation of church and state is bad. (in fact he defended separation of church and state.) the text of the speech is here (among plenty of other places accessible via google search) for people to draw their own conclusions.
339	we do? how do we know that? i will agree that there is not yet proof to make such a link, but i am unaware of proof that there is no link. did i miss something?
340	"If I want ""people"" to think? Kronos, the only one here who's making a big issue of whether or not I state the obvious here is you. You're the one making a big deal of it here. In a case where it's blatantly obvious, as in this one, then obviously there's an issue of homophobia here."
341	do they conver the same types of subject? i have, as yet, not heard much 'good' about american education (nor health), so it's interesting to hear about these things from the horse's mouth (so to speak).
342	do you think banning guns would stop people who wanted them from getting them? also you failed to address my point. is self-defense not a legitimate use for guns?
343	Did you read the article? A capuchin is type of monkey, in this case, the type that was used in the experiment.
344	did you read the artical? to show our children that they are no different then any other.
345	[quote=mae] land that didn't belong to the un or israel. or current american aggression? what's the difference? both are imposing their ideologies by force. you make it sound like choosing a sports team; for or against based on personal opinion.
346	how are they different? both can lead to depression, impaired judgement and decrease in ability. what is the difference? you can't just claim they are completely different and leave it at that. how are they different? you say i fail to provide how sleep [loss] can be just as violent as drugs. you or epaphras_faith have yet to prove that drugs can cause violence. i have just proved that sleep loss causes a decrease in ability and impairs judgement and leads to depression. you haven't proven anything more that drugs does.
347	who said pregnancy is the only bad thing? we already talked about ceverical cancer. furthermore, condoms don't always work...bad protection. maybe not, but wearing a bright red sign that says 'stalk me' sure will get the ones that are out there. your limited world shield you from the realities of life...which is really a bad thing i suppose but it gives a better reason to listen to your parents. aren't you a warm-hearted person you are in cancun talking to people on a pointless forum... does anyone else think this is rather odd?
348	falling, did i say that 'the church alone provides for the needy?' if i did please point it out to me. each religion has its own place to turn, but none of them should ever be able to turn to the federal government. the constitution gives certain delegated powers to the federal government and handing money out for educational purposes is not one of them. socialism is merely the stepping stone into communism, and i don't want to see this nation start down that path. maybe i live by the constitution because it is 'the supreme law of the land.' the question is not why do i live by the constitution, but why don't you? until the constitution is replaced it will govern this land, and i plan to live by it.
349	"So atheism doesn't ""need"" facts? If it claims to have complete knowledge of evolution, doesn't it need all the facts? If the answer is no, then how can it argue against religion? Miller didn't explain it."
350	i'm concerned with u.s. history. i'd rather go back 200 years. i'll see what i can find - out of time tonight however.  isn't the big bang part of evolution? i don't notice atheist authors, or the aclu, using it in politics much.  what else can influence morals?
351	a cop tried that in school and got sued and lost, a private individual will get sued for assault, and false imprisonment at the least. there are more cases each day but one thing the justices did mention was marbury v madison. you can ignore an illegal law with impunity. we have the ruling. we also have past cases quoted in the h eller and mcdonald cases. you implied there were none and that is false. would you like to take a stab at nunn v, state of georgia for instance? star gazer cited a lower court ruling that the gun grabbers used just as sinjin used an earlier, oveturned case in people v zirillo. how can you miss so much?
352	do we want to have control over ourselves? some religios fanatics dont, and thats what im saying. i dont know much on this matter, im only 14. but, ive been to a conservative catholic school, and ive seen what it's like. its a narrow minded hellhole.
353	rrriiigggghhhtttt.... do you really think your opposition to ending medicare / medicaid would just come from the recipients? no. it's like kids being afraid of getting their haircut. it's much adieu over nothing. and then when the haircut is done, they realize it's not as bad as they made it out to be... and they eventually recognize the need for the haircut...
354	so what? jefferson is a prime example in opposites and double standards. he believed in freedom but owned slaves. wrote the declaration of independence yet only believed in freedom for white men not women or people of color. this stance is very consistent with his double standard. he was also an adulterous, womanizer who had sex with his slave women and producing children who would remain slaves. so there again is his double standard he enslaved his own children.
355	the iranian govenment was visibly anti-american. did the filipino and dutch cases have that component? i am still quite convinced that americans would hate iran just as much as they accidentally caused american casualities.
356	can you support this moronic statement? the answer is obviously no. also, why should obama be less responsible for his own words on guns and religion than palin is for the words of her audience? the media will follow palin through the gates of hell and beyond to find something to demonize her. what lengths won't they take to attack republicans?
357	if the distinction matters, then what is your point about promiscuity, exactly? misinformation msleads people into thinking that if the significantly curtail the number of partners they have sex with, that they would eliminate the chance of contracting disease. that is not true. it just takes one time with an infected person. protection is what people should be arguing. it would be much better if people were upfront about sex and sexuality, upfront about their hiv status, and used protection at all times during sex.
358	Quite frankly, that makes absolutely no sense.So conservatives in the blue states will buy more porn because why? Cause they are in a blue state?And liberals in the red states will buy more porn because why? Cause they arein a red state?Your excuses lack any cogent theory behind the scenario.In science, when people put forth a hypothesis they provide a basis for their claim as to the mechanics of the phenomenon.But with you, you just throw out different ideas with no basis.
359	"Ever been to eastern KY? Many of the residents share a very strong faith in the christian religion. They also share abject poverty, malnutrition and starvation, substandard or absent medical care, contaminated water supplies, and dangerous and often poorly heated / ventilated ""housing"". Yes Easy, truly their cups overfloweth."
360	so you are asking how a gravitational field overcomes the intertia of a less massive object placed within said field? i don't know but your question kind of confused me: in this example the only reason the object is not moving is because you are exerting an opposing force to counter that which the warped space has induced on the object (gravity). all that has changed when the object is released is it can accelerate freely and we can observe the resulting notion. i see what you are getting at- the question could be rephrased as how is an object in a region of warped space constantly under an acceleration towards the centre of the gravitional field, the strength of which depends upon the size of the bodies and the distance separating the two?
361	Again, would you please show how this limits anyone's speech in any way? This is just paper work that lobbyists need to fill out, it's not infringing on any rights in any way. You are totally free to buy people to push your agenda, you just need to document that that is what you're doing.
362	i don't follow. 'since those of specific faith...' ???? if you don't believe god, then there is no sin. those that do would choose neither of the above over another. of course, there are some here that would, but that's religion for you.
363	Used against me? I never denied this. Surely you refer to this in terms of gay marriage. Considering I don't believe gay marriage is a right I don't see how my words do you any good.
364	you have to be kidding me. you don't really believe this, do you??? sure they may have white people on from time to time, but obviously they exclude white people since you can turn it on and almost always see only black people. so the criteria of whether something is racist or not is whether or not there is a 'single culture' behind it? i don't see why having a culture behind it is really relevant. things can be racist or not independent of whether there is a culture there.
365	could you see language evolving in non social animals? it wouldnt have a reason to.
366	take it up with who brought it up. who said the idea of it being 'scientific' is the criteria for a theory to be taught in schools?  schools have to have some degree of autonomy to have the curriculum they want without over-regulation. who sets the standard of what's 'scientific' or not?
367	So why are you so afraid of it? If it is bad you will have a choice to go to a private insurance company.
368	it did not because it was not clear till the 1970s that horizontal gene transfer was something to be considered. nobody knew the mechanism till that era. and of course hgt is just another form of variability to be taken into account. genes transfered horizontally are as subject to selection as anyother form of gene. once intergrated into the recieving genome they are simply one more heritable element and if they alter the phenotypes (many are either neutral or even inactivatee) then of course they are subject to selection. why do you think otherwise? remember that horizontal transfer is a rare event roughly on a par with ordinary mutations.
369	Why do you oppose gay marriage? The traditional definition of marriage is as a contract for the purchase of a bride. The wedding is what is sacred. What you are doing is no different than those who opposed marriage betwen people of different races or beliefs as well. You have no valid reason to oppose it either.
370	That's a completely different issue jo. If those pro gay sites were accurately translating and interpreting the bible as it intended itself to be translated, I would accept it with open arms. But how can I accept the lies that homosexual apologists attempt to tell by distorting Gods truth in order to justify their sin? You should understand that I can't allow that rather than you using those corrupted sources in order to support what you personally want the bible to say. I welcome anyone to take the content of the links that tell each story within my link above, and disregard the info if any opposing info is found regarding the claims they make. But just attacking it because it's a jewish source is ridiculous.
371	have you ever burned a flag? have you ever urinated on a pow flag? i thought you said you never did, so i don't see how i am lambasting you for something you have never done. but do you honestly believe it is ok for any person to urinate on a pow flag just because they think they have a good reason to do it? you said it's their judgment call, right? do you see it as disrespectful or sad like i do?  just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
372	When is wealth redistributed on a whim? The NHS is one of the few good things to come out of WWII and is the mark of a fair society (if you ask me). Restricting health-care according to wealth is despotic....
373	i don't think much can be inferred about the relationship between guns and crime by comparing the crime rate of a densely populated city with the crime rate of a whole state. virginia has a higher homicide rate that most canadian provinces which is probably a better comparison-  homicide offences, number and rate, by province and territory is it possible to make it much harder for criminals to obtain guns? yes, i think so. if your boat is sinking then you have to plug all the leaks not just some of them. if you keep plugging the leaks then eventually you'll reach a state in which significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns. why do i say this? because significantly fewer criminals are obtaining guns in developed countries with stricter and more consistent gun laws. in the us, there is too much inconsistency in gun laws.
374	why would anyone want to use aspartame? drink tea or coffee without sweetener or sugar..you get used to it. if you are too fat then eat less.
375	so? the assertion was 'evolution is based on evidence - what do you have' suggesting that one side has 'evidence' and the other none. i am simply 'balancing' it out by showing that the assertion isn't black vs white as made out.
376	obviously i don't have a perfect memory or even that i read what you are referring to. why don't you give me a flavor of their 'factual errors?' and are you talking about their news sections or their opinion pieces? and who wrote it? sometimes in the opinion pieces these are submitted by authors in the nations that are the subject. perhaps this was written by a swedish politician who had an ax to grind.
377	what? you didn't know that religious people are the only ones that are supposed to be silent and never try to take part in democracy, while everyone else gets to do so? where have you been? emoticonxdonno  i wonder sometimes if opponents of religion really even stop to think about what they're really saying.
378	what's your opinion of religious people who believe evolution is merely a part of creation?  there are non-literal creationists out there in large numbers.
379	don't have to change locations for that the majority of the nuts are outside of the institions, i've had my fair share.. thieves bold enough to come in while everbody's home..... true..but the gender most affected? males....
380	religion is nothing but a choice but is constitutionally protected. why? blacks and homosexuals are two different classes, unless you are a black gay. it is the way each class is treated that is the same. coservative christians view gay people in the same way as the white supremacists view black people. the more religion attacks gay people and our civil rights the more i am begining to believe that the romans had the right idea to rid the world of such filth.
381	in the old testament people were punished for the sins they committed. i think he's asking why should we punish people while they are living? god will punish them when they die.
382	if they are used in reference to god, then how can you possibly say they don't refer to god??? jesus himself said he he and his father are one, in john 10:30. and the three appear together numerous times in parallel grammatical construction, denoting equality. it's a harder argument to make that the three are not god and that any one is lesser than the other in terms of divinity, than to say they are god.
383	would you cite the exact article for once in your life? i'm sick of seeing the main page day after day after day.
384	and you believe that to be what? you really need to just say who/what you think the creator is to save us from having to make all these clarification posts.
385	demon, that was quick were you right there? no resentment in my heart friend. i try to translate an expression from hungarian (again i guess that will be poor but i try anyway) 'friendship remains' (or 'unchanged' may be the better word?)  now here is what you asked:  that is a very good question demon, but i would put one more word there 'who'. no insult intended.
386	which will push crude oil prices up in line with the benchmark usd devaluation? treasury interest rates could become interesting. i'm already seeing conventional cd and money market rates on the rise.
387	once again when is my life, what i do, and who i love, who i marry, any more thier business then theirs is to me? you still haven't answered my question. why do they get a say in my life yet i don't get the same say in their lives? anyone who wants to but into other peoples lives in the way these religious xxxxxx are is just cruel and evil. it is my life my family not theirs. they get theirs yet try and stop me from having mine that is unjust. you are defending an unjust system.
388	yeah you're saying what it isn't but not saying what it is. i'm not sure what you mean as physical either. can i ask you out straight -- are you suggesting a metaphysical component to 'you'? this questions just, i feel, needs to be answered because i'm still trying to grasp what your saying. to a degree? as soon as it changes you are something else surely? i would be wraith +1 or, after a heavy night out wraith -20 -- the 'wraith' bit is just seemingly a conveniance to show nothing more than perceived lineage -- i'm not the same frame of refference at any given point as i was a second ago. i might as well be called cow +20 after eating, and assimilating a beef burger, the lineage part really is quite meaningless.
389	there is one major difference between the democratic spending plans and the republican plan (for this election cycle anyway): dems want to repeal the tax cuts, so they have a methodology for paying for all of this. oh, and they haven't been too keen on sending men to mars either. and just a quick aside, was it legal to invade iraq? probably, b/c of the legislation broker cites. but i think he makes a logical leap when he extrapolates 'justified' from 'legal.' the calculus used to say this was a 'just' war is a very dangerous one, and if cross-applied could justify innumerable conflicts (how many nations can legitmately say that another nation has 'dangerous activities' that make it pose an 'imminent threat'? at the very least, the entire mid-east (arab/israel) would explode under that logic).
390	let's wait and see if the chain of possession comes to light.  your demand that any tightening of our firearm sales regulations must curtail all cartel bloodshed. who do you suppose the mexican president hopes to protect from guns arriving from the us?  i am prepared to offer my fingerprint every time i purchase a firearm and so should you. to exclude ourselves from those prohibited from buying.
391	can you think of the mental trauma of having your rapists baby? and then caring for it? for rape victims, no i still don't think abortion should be the first choice, but it should be available.
392	if genesis in the bible is not a literal account of creation (i,e., six days, man from dust, fruit of good and evil) then what is its use? why include as the foundation of the entire bible a story that is either totally fabricated, or mostly inaccurate/metaphorical? genesis 1&2, in the literal application, has 2 vitally important concepts that the entire bible is totally useless without: 1. god is sovereign and totally limitless in power 2. man has disobeyed god and is in need of reconciliation everything else in the entire bible rests on these 2 premises. now if genesis has it wrong, then what is the use of any of the rest of the bible? from all scientific perspective, genesis 1&2 never happened, and here the validity of the entire bible is questioned.
393	d. adams? :)  this is, of course, an entire debate unto itself. i fully concede that logic dictates that we accept the possibility of life elsewhere. but that it's probable? we simply don't have the data to make that leap. we've got some good theories about how life started here, but we don't know exactly what happened. and even if we did, we don't know how common those conditions are 'out there'. if the conditions for life to arise are so bizarre that they only occur once every 20 billion years, and for all we know they might be, than we may well be the only life in the universe. logically, we just can't say. we don't have enough info to apply logic to the problem.
394	really? so suppose that you have two models for the way the solar system works. you measure where the planets are today in the night sky, and you use both models to predict where the planets will be ten years from now. in ten years you make actual measurements. the predictions of the first model for mars are off by, say, a tenth of a minute of arc. the second model is off by a hundredth of a minute of arc. (for comparison, the full moon in the sky has a width of about 30 minutes -- i may be wrong about this). so, are you saying the first model is wrong? the error seems to be pretty tiny (by most standards). what about the second?
395	ok, so none can be shown. how many people with a life sentence without parole have died an prison and been innocent?  my point being that a mistake doesn't make the sentence not worth having. in fact, with the death penalty you get more due process than someone with a life sentence...there aren't many advocates for helping those guys out.
396	i concede that it can go to a ballot. you have been arguing that such an issue should go to a ballot.  care to comment on the second point i made? to some extent this thread is about whether anyone should be concerned that all the petition signers realized what they were signing (in the context of proven wide-spread fraud on the part of the signature gatherers).
397	Yes, and George Dubya Bush and the GOP know it's unconstitutional.Would it really bother you so much if the feds recognized a Massachusetts or California or New York or New Jersey same-sex marriage while other states like Alabama and Utah could ban same-sex marriage?I could live with that. Most gay people already leave those states anyway.
398	do you know what a fatwa is ? the burden of proof is on those who want an invasion, iran can not prove that is not trying to develop a nuclear weapon. you can not prove a negative. honestly i don't think people have learned the lesson from the iraq war.  what did we hear before that invasion from the warmongers in the us and uk ?  the exact same thing we are hearing at the moment. that the regime is evil, they have wmd, they have links to aq etc surely the people are not dumb enough to fall for the same tripe again ?
399	then why is it that closeted homosexuals that are completely unknown to be gay commit suicide at such a high rate? they aren't persecuted or harassed at all since no one knows they are even having these feeling? it is self loathing that feeds their desire to harm themselves. people who know that what they are is right and good, don't harm themselves at all, but defend and support who they are even when persecuted by others. that's how it was for me when i converted from islam to christianity. all of the persecution i received just made me stronger.
400	that is a specious argument. the constitution is not an embodiment of what is good and evil for humans to do, but of what is of value in a free society. the constitution does not judge the goodness and badness of human character. ideas for laws come from morality? the concept of morality came from a desire to survive as we evolved. so you see the law preventing someone from interfering with your life as the same as the law allowing someone to interfere with your life?
401	you havent answered my question. if evolution is lacking the hard, observable evidence you say it's lacking, then surely you should have lots to say about atomic theory. however, you dont. why not? unification theory is different - theres no dependency on that theory like there is with chemistry or biology.
402	originally posted by fracas only way to be more efficient is to continue to wage war preferentially against technologically similar sides are we back to a us-eu war? sorry i took that the wrong way, but regardless, the kind of thinking that leads to wars and seeing who has the largest most powerful military is precisely what i'd like to get away from in order to advance the military. yes we learn from war, but its wasteful, i'm proposing a not so wasteful military.
403	jito, i forgot to thank you for agreeing with me on eugenics. what is that?...the second or third time we have ever agreed? well, you have only 8,966 more things to agree on with me to show you have converted to proper thinking! emoticonxangel  consent is relevant when it is relevant. do you deny that women engaging in sexual intercourse (outside of rape or some other type of coercion) give consent to engage in an act that may result in pregnancy? i never said that sex was only for procreation and i don't believe it is. i do believe, however, that the procreative potential of sex must be respected. i do believe that when a being comes about as the result of a sexual act then that being should be respected.
404	just how many cases do you want to read that says exactly what i am quoting? i just gave you a taste of things to come...like the right to be left alone. even the 10 year census, all that is required by the xivth amendment i: 1. number of people who live there 2. sex of each 3. age of each that completes the enumeration and registration for the census. i will ask the 3rd time before i cover you up with cases, show me the enumerated power of any branch of government to require a person to register any right, much less firearms.
405	read the rest of the post. i added to it before you responded to make what i said clearer: why would you be maligning them if they were not bad? the intended effect is that you would deserve the same maligning you were giving since what you were doing was equally as bad. since you malign something bad, it is generally understood to mean that the speaker considers you to be as bad as those you malign.
406	you want sources saying that bo had 2 communist parents? voted to the left of socialist sanders?? is loved by cpusa was mentored by rev. wright and frank marshall davis?? supports single payer??? tell us which is propaganda???
407	Our side? I don't get the impression we're on the same side.Besides, I think the subject is decreasing the number of unwanted pregnancies.
408	what would make e-mail any easier? both the forum and most e-mails have spell checks. wouldn't e-mail be harder to use since referencing specific paragraphs be really difficult? sounds like trying to organize it over e-mail would be a logistical nightmare.
409	Yes, but I think you missed my point. I stated this above, remember the prohabition? People actually drank MORE alchohal. Without a ban, law abiding citizens and criminals will have them, with a ban, there will be just criminals.
410	does the grand canyon strike you as a 'crack' as well? like? what makes them so dangerous if it ain't their guns and their willingness to use them?  this assumes that no da is presently going after them. something i highly doubt.  diversionary tactic on your part. wouldn't making guns harder for them to acquire be helpful?
411	ms. bennet, in your opinion, is the anglican church apostolic? if so, what is the case that it presents for apostolic succession? the roman church did not start as an imperial church. the empire wasn't around for 300 years or so. i think many martyrs of the faith would differ with that assertion. it started at peter's appointment as the foundation of the church and was solidified in the upper room after jesus' resurrection. why do you desire to receive communion at a catholic church?
412	"I posted two versions:1. I am a rational being. Is it logical to assume that a rational entity formed me? (not my parents--on a mankind scale) Is it more logical than to assume that I generated out of inanimate matter incapable of logic? Generated due to ""miraculous"" odds? I'm not sure what the numbers are. I think the logical sequence is a belief in a higher power rather than a springboard to logic from a primordial soup of nothing.2. I came up with a belief in the supernatural via natural logic--I am a rational being. I could not have therefore come from irrational combinations of inanimate matter that somehow combined to form rational animate matter. I came from a rational source."
413	do you realize, that the fetus has only recently not been defined as a human being. back when birth control first came out, planed parenthood wanted to make sure it would be leagle. so they redefined 'life' to say that you had to draw breth. by the way have you ever seen any pictures of the aborted babies? 'cause they sure like humans to me. you know most of them can already move before the abotion? look into the court hearings of judge ricard c. caey in new york. if you want to know the truth about abortion.
414	Folding proteins... Show me where and how this happens. Why is it that one protein is able to fold into the right shape to attach itself to another? If this is happening all the time we'd see more mutations all the time.Good theory you've got there. Saying something can happen doesn't mean that it does!
415	separate but equal is never equal? which are better? boys' or girls' bathrooms? other than that last statement i agree 100%. i don't believe gay civil unions are separate but equal but i do believe they could be if we wanted them to be. unfortunately the people who seem to only be against redefining marriage and for civil unions never want to give gays all the rights of marriage in a civil union.
416	take a look at your post no. 80 time-stamped 6-26-06 09:55am wherein you said ...in response to my post #79 wherein i said: does that not comply with my claim that you change what i say? back in post #77, i requested that you quote and debunk the links. you merely scoffed at them (as i expected). prior to initiating any other question to me or introducing a tangential argument, please explain the above. i'll be back next week.
417	what if it's got nothing to with bigotry? what if, like religion, it takes absolute proof in order to be believed? i think that's what it's going to take. don't you?
418	so their support of bush (so you say) means exactly what? that they were listening to the sound bytes dished out by bush's rhetoric? and where is bush is the man and jim's trucking? usually they're all over it when someone says something bad about the american people. oh, that's right... it's ok when a person on the right says it, it's when it said by a liberal like moore that it becomes an issue.
419	but that doesn't answer the question. why is dawkins a xxxxx to believe as he does? it seems that you have no answer except to throw out indiscriminate insults at people you know nothing about. in a previous post you stated, 'the guys a simpleton.' that doesn't make sense as there is no verb in the sentence. 'guys' is the plural of 'guy'. you don't seem to be aware that the contraction for 'guy is' is 'guy's.' your error is caused by ignorance whereas trebor's is clearly a typo caused by the proximity of the 'e' and 'd' keys. do you have a better explanation for our origins that doesn't involve magic and dirt?
420	bin laden said on that tape that muslims should support iraq. why? iraq is secular. he shouldn't want iraq to be supported... he hates non-muslims. hmm... thistown, who cares what people think? it's a bad idea to set foreign policy by opinion polls. 85% of our population was opposed to entering ww ii before pearl harbor while hitler was killing millions, and we knew all about it. that was the wrong thing to do.  i bet the chancellor is relaxing with a cool glass of french wine waiting for his term to end...his people hate him. he's holding his stance to gain popularity, playing politics. our president blew him off, he's killed relations, and he knows it.
421	and how does this differ from life insurance or car insurance? or for credit cards, for that matter? the cost of a policy, or card, is proportional to the risk assumed by the insurer. don't want to pay high premiums, take the risk on yourself. period. i find it morally unacceptable to steal money from people in order to satiate another's morality. we have no god-given right to live forever as far as i know.
422	if someone is an attorney or in law enforcement, would you please give an interpretation? thank you.
423	morals are what you make them to be. for example, 'it's ok to kill youths if they've insulted your prophets' is another possible one. the ones in my joshua example? he doesn't tell them, nor did i say that he told them. look at what i said: 'the morality of the old testament peoples (god included) is definitely questionable.'. however, in the next chapter he does immediately reward them, by protecting them from the angry reprisals of the neighbouring villages: '5 then they set out, and the terror of god fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.' note that in the other examples, god is either commanding it (through the proxy of a speaker) or directly doing it (pillar of salt, bears etc).
424	"So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying?  Your statement ""An abortion never has to be done"" only holds true if you place the value of the unborn child over that of the mother in all cases. Do you really believe that?"
425	Well do you mean Texas or Texans? Because Texas holds the record for execusions in the US. Not something I'd be proud of.
426	it is silly to focus on the tools and not bad people who misuse these tools, especially when the tools in question can be easily smuggled as well as made in a modestly-equipped machine shop. also, why do many of those who supposedly have a political orientation that favors freedom and opposes tyranny want to severely and arbitrarily limit the rights of tens of millions of people who have not, and show no indication of wanting to, unjustly hurt anyone with these tools?  it is wrong to tell people that they cannot put certain substances in their bodies and have abortions, just as it is wrong to tell people that they cannot have certain precision-machined metal/polymer/wood objects in their own homes.
427	do you have any evidence of this that doean't come from a biased christian website? so here is where you are saying nanny, nannie, poo,poo my straight realtionship is better than your gay relationship. how? some big claims, can you provide some substance to them, in other words can you back this up with some data? that doesn't come from some christian baised study.
428	economically it is great. heck, it would even be better if robots did all our jobs for us at almost no expense. sure the corporations would be fine with that because they would profit but what about the average person who cannot find a job? sending jobs over seas doesn't hurt our economy but it doesn't help billy who lost his job to it. i'm not suggesting that we stop outsourcing jobs but i am suggesting that while our jobless rate increases that our government do something to keep some jobs here.
429	that's an interesting observation. by what means are you reasonably sure? do you think the other religions have the same take on it as you do? i used to think the same: if there is only one god, then they had to be worshipping the same, just giving him different names. then i was introduced to matt.7. clearly god only wants identifying (ex.6:3, 15:3 etc.) and worshipping one way, therefore all other religions have to be wrong. just a thought.
430	and as i've already pointed out, this notion that god needs to glorify himself smacks of narcissism on a cosmic scale. why would god in any way need -- or even want -- to demonstrate his glory? he's god: he knows how glorious he is! isn't that enough? and again, as already pointed out, i don't find arbitrary salvation of an undeserving few to be merciful, nor do i find arbitrary damnation of an undeserving many to be just. the calvinist vision of god strikes me as a celestial tyrant.
431	And what if he had said fiance? Would you have suddently admitted that their love is real? Pointing out a different word choice than you would have used doesn't appear to mean anything.If you are certain that their love is not real, why don't you explain your reasoning that led you to this conclusion? It seems to me that a gay person knows his own love better than someone who has never even met that gay person. Do you have some knowledge which disagrees?
432	So what? That means in a firefight with police, the criminal will run out of ammunition in a matter of seconds and be ripe for the picking.
433	exactly who are you saying has revised the bible? and with that question asked, i believe by admitting that if it was revised to delete the meat of it, it would be equally diluted in power, content and strength.  really? if you're speaking about jefferson still, then why didn't he recommend that all punishments for homosexuality be erased from the law completely, and homosexuality be legalized at that time? that would have been the just and magnanimous thing to do if he believed such tripe as you attribute to him.
434	mind if i ask if you drive yet? if so do you have any points on your license? 2mph seriously isn't a huge ammount and neither your speedo or the mobile cameras are usually calibrated to be that accurate.
435	your previous posts never mentioned underage sex with middle age men. underage sex is underage sex, dont try to move the goalposts. why the last five years? you asked if i had children because i stated that modern slasher films were as dangerous as simulated paedophilia. why did you ask?
436	did you not say, 'these people need to be stopped?' or was that still part of the article? if that was you, then that is a viewpoint that, if implemented, will directly influence public policy. you say you do not want to make this country a theocracy, right? well, do you want to make it/keep it a non-theocracy? if so, you are trying to extend/keep an ideology imposed through government. i'm not saying that is bad; i am only saying it is what it is.
437	good one, johnhanks. (glad you included the 'pleased with the outcome' part). :p  what about the emotional aspect? the moral aspect? again - we are leaving religion out of it. au fait?  not talking about religion on this part either, now john. as i stated earlier: what is a piece of paper to two people in love?
438	the government has no business invading into the private, legal activities of two individuals. and how is requirement able to defeat straw purchasers? if you don't feel comfortable making the sale, don't make it. it's as simple as that.
439	even with tax deductible status, i seriously doubt there's enough of a market available yet to make privatization a going concern. since all people will ostensibly benefit from whatever flows from the space program, it seems like government is still the only option now. sure, the russians are capitalizing on their experience by taking citizens for rides, but what are they really learning or advancing there? they're getting more and more vocal about us funding their stupid space station. the europeans are primarily interested in the lucrative satellite-launching business; again, where's the hard science? so it seems to fall to the americans -- surprise. but if we don't do it, the chinese certainly will. in all probabilities, they will be fierce competitors, imo.
440	because it shows that your data is not absolute, and that there is supporting evidence for both sides? it also stops you justifiably saying things like... the data speaks for itself. in america, guns save more lives than are taken by them. fact. did you know that in the uk, i am statistically at least twice less likely to be killed than you? fact. it works both ways...
441	Pro-choice? Why do you assume I'm pro-choice? I often play devil's advocate...I was using china as an example to show you that people when desperate, trying to get around laws (in this case the 1 child law), will abandon their children to death in the gutter -- it was unrelated to abortion laws -- it was an illustration of as aspect of human nature, which you deny.
442	but aren't the exchanges primarily aimed at those who can't get insurance otherwise? i would have thought that if insurance was so little used by young people, insurers would be keen to get their business, and premiums would be low. maybe insurance is more necessary for young people than you think?
443	Don't be so faithful in our laws. Remember prohibition? Of course, I myself highly doubt that Obama will manage to ban firearms, but mark my words, he will do anything in his power to restrict them.
444	That just sounds alarmist to me. Do you realize the actual implications of taking away second amendment rights? It is just not going to happen.
445	now isn't that a terribly socialistic position to take? but, i'm confused by it at the same time, for socialists like you don't really want to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs now do you? emoticonxrolleyes when logic fails, there's alway ad hominem, right? and the ad hominen continues..... we're larger, more diverse, more litigious, need i go on? leaving the continued ad hominem aside, one of the causes for our high healthcare costs is litigation. since the dnc survives on the money derived from the blood-sucking trial lawyers lobby, i don't see real reform occurring until we cut those purse strings along with the big pharma's.
446	if i recall correctly, many of the fires were started at about the same time, so more than one person seems likely. and weren't they mostly black churches that have been targeted? i wouldn't discount racism as the motive.
447	if you want to use this arguement then you are assuming a right to free speech seperate from the 1st amendment. you are applying the first amendment but rather assuming 'free speech' is a right granted outside of the constitution. i believe our argument is dealing with applying the first amendment to the states. the case didn't deal with the first amendment at all. where did you get that idea from? it dealt with religion but that is about as close as it gets. ok? was there ever any doubt that the 1st amendment was incorporated since cantwell?
448	where did you get this from? i want to read it.
449	"Inconsistent how? If you give me specific quotes of mine that were inconsistent, I will be more able to respond. I never said I didn't know. I said there is no empirical evidence. That is not synonymous with not knowing. The word ""proof"" as I am using it is subjective. What if proof enough for me is not for you. What is proof for me is not empirical. According to my definition, I have proof. It's just not proof that you will accept. It comes down to a simple difference of epistemology. I believe that personal metaphysical evidences can be accepted, you don't. End of story."
450	do you mean when pelosi said the protestors had nazi banners, when they were actually banners saying 'no' to nazism? she's in the democrats. you mean the fantasy land whitehouse version of the proposals, that no one has actually read? no one that understands the constitution would say that, that's a very ignorant comment. what's perverted is that you think freedom of speech means the people have to shut up while they listen patiently to the government propaganda machine.
451	are you trying to say that people of faith cannot tell the difference between myth and reality? i'm actually confused by this sentence.
452	Thats an odd analogy. Can a child survive without its mother? I'd say a baby is no less dependent on its mother the first few years than it is when in it grew in the womb.  Is the child still a parasite then?
453	"He had ALREADY MADE the animals. ""now the Lord God HAD FORMED..."" not ""now the Lord God formed..."" See the difference? He already HAD FORMED the animals before he brought them to Adam. He made the animals before Adam."
454	if you want the benefits of marriage, get married. but you ought to be able to marry a person of your choice. your suggestion would be to marry someone i don't want to me married to, that is a different thing. it is not using 'that logic'. i thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you. isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities? i am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly. i happen to think that's a bad idea. people get married for many reasons, some of which i would feel are not good reasons, but i would not make it illegal to do so.  i am talking about the right to marry a person of your choosing.
455	So you are saying that the democrats have no choice but to inaugarate Brown and let him stop the bill? You suggest that whatever option they pick will be political suicide.
456	But is the gun that you keep in your home a greater risk to yourself or to a potential intruder? It's pretty easy to find information on the FBI and the CDC websites that shows that more people die in gun accidents than criminals die in legally justifiable self defense shootings. People defending guns often only look at the gross benefit of gun ownership, not the net benefit when it comes to safety. That would make about as much sense as only looking at your gross income while ignoring the fact that your net income is negative.
457	could you clarify the italicized sentence for me, please? i don't understand if you are saying that the fetus takes priority or not. if so, why?thanks...monday morning fogginess.
458	backpedaling? how's that? my original answer is that it's wrong to force children to have sex with old men. that is my answer still. where has it changed? in fact, each post i've made is an affirmation of the one before it. how is that backpedaling? there are absolute goods and evils. that is, there are certain things that are good or bad. how is that saying something different? certain things are bad. period. just like certain things are wrong, no matter how many people think that they aren't wrong. period. is that clear enough for you? i hope so because that's what i've been saying all along and you'd have to be high to think i've changed my position.
459	you guys just don't get it do you? this isn't about an attack on christianity. this isn't about anti-christians, and in the end, this isn't about the cross, or any other religious symbol for that matter, offending anyone. this is about keeping religion from meddling with government, but just as, if not more, important, it is about keeping government from meddling with religion, and the moment they intertwine, there are possibilities for many dangerous things to happen. and by the way, i'm a christian, and i don't want my government in any way defining any part of what i hold dear. p.s. sandycane- most buddhists aren't in india.
460	best interests of the nation as opposed to what? other people outside it? i reject any notion that one nation should be promoted regardless of the effects on others. faithful to what exactly? if an oath makes you do something you wouldn't otherwise do, it makes you a slave. if it doesn't make you do anything you wouldn't otherwise do, it is pointless anyway.
461	You said who would it hurt? I'm asking you who would it hurt if there was prostituion? Just to help you think that there are injuries that are proximate to everyone.
462	Actually, what gay marriage proponents simply want is to be treated like every one else. Denying the right to marriage because of his/her sexual orientation makes them second class citizens. The supporters of the anti-gay movement simply want to impose their moral values on to the rest of the public, the recent prop 8 ballot initiative proves it. Ever read John Locke or JS Mill? You should, it's what our country ideals are based on. You have your bubble and I have mine so just leave me alone; and the majority are never always right and should not have a say in what is moral or just based on their beliefs.
463	You have any examples of that? Shooting people for throwing rocks and eggs at houses that is.
464	1) i dont recall saying anything that i believed 2) someones experiences should definitly be looked at you are just one rude person. i was just sharing an experience my mom had teaching. not only that, youe are comparing a pedophiliac to a gay man adopting. what does this prove? i never said all striaight families are perfect and i never said all gay families are bad either. all i stated was one persons direct observations on the situation. how many child of gay couples have you taught? observed? 30 years worth? i believe i will take someones experience over you being rude.
465	your right about the 14 year old and the ten year old but if it is a 18 and 14 should that be legal? or 18 and 15? 16 and 21 is legal (although it is wrong) because the youngest one is still legal. age of consent = 16 years old. if your basing it on a year gap what about 10 years? i am 10 years older than my fiance. before anyone jumps to conclusions i am 38. and she is 28. legal? why? we are both over 16.......period.
466	have you ever considered the possibility that he cares about you? that he knows you? and that he cares about those in the womb? this is always the charge hurled at me but it is never founded. you cannot find any misogyny in my writings but rather a great respect for women and their value and dignity. this is why i argue so strongly against abortion. yet, any oppression, or insecurity, or hardship, or difficulty they face, though real and challenging, is not justified in the face of destroying the life in the womb. though abortion reigns freely and forcefully and abundantly still the oppression and abuse of women endure. one reason they endure is that people are looking in the wrong place for a solution--they are looking to abortion when it offers no solution.
467	what laws? as far as i know you are allowed to do so. w/o the ordinance though.  i'm familiar w/ mr. konsen's paper, but i shy away from so broad a definition. i think defining 'arms' as weapons that may be carried by a man a good, and true definition.
468	As in we, do you mean we the USA or we, the World ? Because this is a World wide issue and not something the US can solve on its own in any case.
469	"That who knows? Your use of ""we"" does not include many religious folk I assume. I would claim to know of much interaction that God has and has had with the world."
470	State money, but no state accountability...yea right.Private schools don't even have to hire certified/qualified teachers! Oh come on? That's a travesty.
