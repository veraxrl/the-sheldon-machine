1	1	a	More chattering from the peanut gallery? Haven't gotten the memo, you're no longer a player? Honestly....clamoring for attention is so low budget. No shame.
2	1	a	Yep, suppressing natural behavior is always the way to go. We should also get them to stop pooping.
3	1	a	I guess we all missed your point Justine, whatever it might have been. emoticonXConfused Better luck next time. emoticonXGood
4	1	a	Evidence, I dont need no sticking evidence. This is what I beleive, and thats it, but I will dig up some proof that supports my point.
5	1	a	And I would appreciate your refraining from calling your mythology a theory.
6	1	a	What is it that you disagree with? My statement of fact? Or the fact that I made a politically incorrect assertion? emoticonXConfused
7	1	a	Tell you what-get your math and science skills up to a grade 6 level and I'll consider taking advice from you, 'kay?
8	1	a	"In my case, it isn't 'god fearing'.. so much as ""believer fearing'"
9	1	a	yeah just like you and your idols Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, etc.
10	1	a	"HOLY COW!!!! Is this the ""Sacred Institution of Marriage"" you and jyoshu are so fervent to protect?"
11	1	a	So a gun is a fire hazard in a public place? I gotta say the gun haters are getting more creative with their arguments.
12	1	a	Oh gosh , a whole bunch of cut/pastes from a 14 year old that is showing off their lack of knowledge. These are not unknown situations, and are very easily explained.
13	1	a	Wow, everyone's just shakin' in their boots that your imaginary god will magick them off the earth! emoticonXKillemoticonXKillemoticonXKillemoticonXBanghead
14	1	a	Quite amusing that you refer to westerners as Gringos. The last time I heard that was in a film about Pancho villa!
15	1	a	It looks like just Mucusaur, you and me, along with an entire thread of bots! (I'm not too sure about Mucusaur, to be honest!) ;)
16	1	a	Ah, historical inevitability. I had no idea you were a marxist, Steeeeve! Unfortunately for you the same argument applies to the collapse of capitalism. And once again you conflate capitalism and freedom. Have you never heard of anarcho-syndicalism? And why is someone more free when their life is controlled by corporations than when those corporations are restrained by a democratic government?
17	1	a	"I have no idea what ""women's rights"" might be either. You could try to explain that to me while you are at it."
18	1	a	"Says the one who calls everyone who disagrees with him about politics a ""Bush hater"" and then cowardly runs away. emoticonXRolleyes"
19	1	a	You can thank Slick Willie Clinton who pushed through the sub-prime lending fiasco that eventually blew up under Bush. And gay-boy Barney Franks who oversaw the program.
20	1	a	Don't even think about contriving how gay marrige violates YOUR RIGHTS assmonkey. That's the most ludicrous, inane statement I have yet heard from the Religious Right.
21	1	a	"Look, the ""no one was around to see it"" argument. ""If a tree falls in the woods, and no one was around to see it, did it really fall?"" You lost this one a long time ago, too. You never learn."
22	1	a	Well, this guy is so bad ad arguing and so good at alienating people that if we sent him into the abortion forum, it is likely, he'd be so ineffective at defending his pro-life position thathe'd actually be contributing to the pro-choice position...
23	1	a	Another red herring gay argument. Ever hear of a medical power of attorney? You don't need marriage to have one, you know. emoticonXRolleyes
24	1	a	Anyone wanna make any bets on who the newbie is here???
25	1	a	Doctor, not guy/gal. Say the words...... A doctor.   Baby is synonymous with infant. Is fetus synonymous with infant? Strange, isn't it?
26	1	a	Dude, it's, like, all over the Bible, man! Maybe if you hit your forehead with Bibles more often, you would know these things!
27	1	a	Wow, that must be some good stuff he was drinking to keep him 'under the influence' for THAT long!! :p
28	1	a	Lets all make vast generalizations that are not true. Seems fun emoticonXRolleyes
29	1	a	That must be why they like to wear boots in Texas.
30	1	a	"Only those ignorant of science and evolution think that ""evolution"" has anything to do with the Bible. I guess that's because creationism is an attempt to pretend that mythology is somehow scientific and makes silly statements about science. It seems that science is somehow anti-Bible in that case when science debunks ignorance."
31	1	a	So why did you say pot was worse than alcohol? Just because both are apparently bad, doesn't make one 'worse'. I'll point out that you compared the two first, so saying it's dumb to compare the two's shooting yourself in the foot.
32	1	a	No but it will be funny to see what sex tapes this tramp did too....
33	1	a	Yes, it doesn't agree with your agenda so it must be trolling.
34	1	a	Apparently someone doesn't read. Trebor was talking about me not being jewish in the following quote.
35	1	a	Probably neat excuse. Do you expect jim to back that claim up? emoticonXGood Don't hold your breath.
36	1	a	"We all agree that abortion is ""killing"". Killing something that has yet to become self aware is different IMO. Funny you request an open ""mind"". My point is that it ain't a human being if it ain't got no mind. That's why they unplug you when you're brain dead."
37	1	a	"Excuse me?! Didn't AIDS started because your homies either ate or did the nasty with monkeys, thereby crossing the species boundary? What did it have to do with ""da man""? And crime and poverty in Africa is also the white devil's doing? emoticonXConfused"
38	1	a	It probably was a bunny suit that he was supposed to wear. I guess he changed his mind, once again, and decided to wear this suit.
39	1	a	THe religious reigh is not mainstream either. And frankly, you are also confusing politics and religion. You do KNOW that there is a difference? You also know there is a differnece between hateful proclimations and scholarship, don't you??
40	1	a	I'm not going anywhere with this thread. I just wanted to point out the obvious hypocrisy of everything your side represents, and nothing more. You all go right ahead and massage your shallow World views.
41	1	a	Well, I guess you got something there. . . . . .can't put the cart before the hose!!
42	1	a	The VPC has a political agenda. The FBI? That is like saying I believe Coke taste better than Pepsi because the Coke commericial says so.
43	1	a	So what you're saying is that by mentioning both in the same post, I'm saying that unless someone is a YEC then they aren't a christian? Because that is what you attributed to me. Yet you have yet to post evidence of me saying that to anyone. Nor have you supported your original claim here, you said this: Last I checked, no credible fossil fuel firm hired YEC geologists. Prove this assertion since you researched it thoroughly enough to start a thread about.
44	1	a	We came from apes not created. Why can't people figure that out did any body go to school around here.
45	1	a	So, how many unborn babies did your God drown in Genesis? Talk about hypocrisy.
46	1	a	Not only would I throw the switch, I'd pay the electric bill, too. emoticonXGood
47	1	a	Stick with the bass guitar. emoticonXRolleyes   And if you break a string....TRY not to blame it on Clinton. :p
48	1	a	Over the Internet that can be a particularly difficult call...
49	1	a	Why would I want lies , deceptions and superstition? I mean, if believing in Jesus makes people act like you, NO THANKS
50	1	a	Because the NY Times, CNN, ABC, Dan Rather, and Handgun Control are all atheist-lead and anti-Christianity. Yeah.
51	1	a	Well, when the people who market prayer come up with evidence that it works as described, let us know! As a meditation technique, it might work fine, who knows, but then, so do many other methods.
52	1	a	Buy stock in the failing banks? What a great investment. Tell me, where does the money come from?
53	1	a	I'll let you know if or when I'm ignoring you, O Hell-bound spawn of Satan.
54	1	a	so if right now, i ask god for forgivness, someone kills me, i will go to heaven by default? makes sense to me, i mean, i dont have time to sin...
55	1	a	Not quite sure what you are talking about, Iangb. And I really don't have time to crack the code so if you have a specific question, just ask it already.
56	1	a	Are you being dense on purpose? I said that I'm not all into the semantics of baby/fetus. I'll conceid that its killing a baby. The TERM for it is fetus, fetus' become babies. I see the logic there (in fact I think I'm agreeing with you). Why must you keep pounding this drum?
57	1	a	When do you advocate breeding blond haired, blue eyed citizens to purify the US?
58	1	a	that's right, i don't want ANOTHER parental figure to tell me what to do, when to do it, and how to do it.
59	1	a	...or we could feed the criminals to the dinosaurs!...save the cows for meatloaf.
60	1	a	You question others sources and credibility yet you parade around under the name of a giant cartoon Shake?
61	1	a	* - edit: you know, actually, evidence in the form of experimental results are reviewed, or at least the methods are reviewed, and then if the experiment isn't reproducible then the evidence becomes suspect, so in that light evidence is, sort of, reviewed. Eh, who cares?)
62	1	a	And yet here we are and neo-Darwinism continues to have empirical support right and left with no sign of it being falsified in sight as of yet. Why might that be? And you Bertvan do not exist since you are so highly improbable. Therefore I can safely assume that your post above just happened without your existense.
63	1	a	Said like a lazy, ignorant person who would rather live off the sweat of others than go out and earn for himself.
64	1	a	Yeah, so will slaves who don't know their Biblical place under their masters, and women who don't submit to men.
65	1	a	So you haven't got an answer to the question and prove that you are 'busted'.. That's OK...as long as we can all see that.
66	1	a	You wouldn't. More likely you'll pursue your Wiccan follies until Judgment Day and then wonder what hit you.
67	1	a	If I had said that, I would have been wrong. But the fact is that I didn't say that. You seem to have a problem in undertanding English. Let me help. Here is what I said:
68	1	a	It is also enough for me to realize you people are using words without definitions.
69	1	a	Yeah. It's snowing sooner here in the Midwest. I think the next Ice Age is coming.
70	1	a	"Yeeees, that's why option 4 as I wrote it says ""reinterpret"" as opposed to ""reject.""   Having a bad reading day, eh?"
71	1	a	It also isn't a baby yet either. It is called a fetus.
72	1	a	You already screwed them over when you decided to cover their country in radioactive dust. Depleted uranium is a real bitch.
73	1	a	"You know my answer: There is no god and no one ""created"" mankind. But the discussion over the existence of god belongs rightly under ""Religious"" or ""Philosophy"" section, not abortion.   Is this one of the tactics you fundies frequently practice? Change the subject when you are about to lose?"
74	1	a	No, you at least need a sling shot and ball bearings, lol.
75	1	a	And you are only trying to earn yourself brownie points in hell.
76	1	a	And like I said, your opinion is worth exactly NOTHING. emoticonXRolleyes
77	1	a	"Are you kidding me?! You think that blacks living in Third World Carribean and African countries are ""content?!"" They're starving by the tens of thousands per day or living so far below the poverty level that it's unimaginable. Maybe you should wander off the beach sometime and see for yourself."
78	1	a	The horsehoe bend was cretaed by the flood in the image of the immaculate horseshoe. repent heathen!
79	1	a	I know, maybe the American criminals will just import guns in with their Mexican illegal drugs. I don't know for sure but I believe the Mexican Drug gangs wouldn't mind another revenue stream. Net results, Zilch, nada, zero. But you know that! emoticonXSmilie Gun control is nothing but a scam!
80	1	a	Careful now, Simone. A lesser man might report you to the moderator.;)
81	1	a	If the same question had been posed by different polls over time it would be easier to draw trends from the responses..... but good luck with finding some trends in amongst that lot.
82	1	a	Ah, the esteemed Washington Times, the rag of that Korean Reverend who does the mass marriages and other weird stuff--um, what's his name now?
83	1	a	Haaaaa Haaaaa Haaaaaaah haahhhha HAhaaaa. My GOD I can't stop laughing Heeee Haaaa.
84	1	a	Well you wouldn't have to 5hit yourself everytime you walked down the streets if you had a gun yourself.
85	1	a	"Your problem is that you take the Bible as the Literal Word of the Invisible man which everyone with a brain knows it is NOT. There are other ""Sins' listed in the old testament that you ignore and try to explain away but you know as well as I that Jesus did not change the Laws. If you want others to live by your False book of fairy tales it would be a Good Idea for you to read it and follow it yourself first. Choosing one or two scriptures and using them to attack people is only making you look foolish."
86	1	a	Good news. It seems as time goes on Arizona attempts to become more and more intolerant and bigoted. Thankfully he put an end to this one (too bad not the immigration one).
87	1	a	Once again archie squirms when the definition of regime is pointed out to him and it nullifies his claims.........
88	1	a	Two Vikings on one board? Time to beat a hasty retreat before I'm pillaged emoticonXChicken
89	1	a	Once again, you have attempted to use the Bible to further your agenda and have been found lacking. emoticonXRolleyes
90	1	a	So you are saying that we determine our DNA? Do you actually think before typing?
91	1	a	Ha.a.a.a :p emoticonXGood Good one, sinjin.  What is the sound of one hand clapping.....?  Ladywolf,  Your answer will probably come from many different sources. Your idea that it evolved is pretty-much it, IMO.
92	1	a	Oh, look, removing a quote from its context. How about your address my textbook definition next?
93	1	a	Only some? what's this then:  hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Pakicetus_(1).jpg  Replace the xx with tt in case you're wondering why I put the link up like that, it's the stupid post count thingy.
94	1	a	Is this a rational statement? If so, prove it rationally, by science.
95	1	a	Let me return the kindness. The correct spelling is ==> especially
96	1	a	It is only difficult to sort out if you are a neocon and fail to recognize that neocons are nothing but militant liberals.   Bush was BY FAR the most liberal president we have had for at least 20 years.   Maybe you need to research traditional conservative values.
97	1	a	What, pray, is a real answer? Because, you know, if it is anything like a corrcect answer you are doing a rather poor job of it, mate.
98	1	a	The riddles continue? emoticonXConfused Wouldn't it have taken less time and have been less ambiguous if you or Dr Spock just posted the # of the post?emoticonXRolleyes emoticonXRolleyes
99	1	a	My pursuit of happiness is denied by trees existing. Let's burn them down and destroy the environment. It's much better than me being unhappy.
100	1	a	"Pathetic, why would you let anyone besides yourself determine who you call family? Nobody is forcing their religion on you. Nobody is even saying who you can or can't get married to. What is being said is that you, or anyone else, doesn't have the ""right"" to have that marriage recognized by gov't. Universal recognition by gov't doesn't even happen in hetro marriages. Nowhere in the founding documents of this nation does it say ""All gov't entities shall recognize all people's marriages"". Since we have ""a government for the people by the people"", the duties of government not spelled out in the founding documents are determined by the people. You have the freedom to vote your beliefs and so does everybody else."
101	1	a	Of course I can't. Can you guarantee that the apparent mugging about to happen isn't some poor slob about to ask directions?   Big guy, dark parking lot, bang bang. Better safe than sorry, eh?
102	1	a	"Yup. Give me an example of a true inaccuracy, instead of working to poke fun. Do you honestly think anyone will take you seriously (except the evolutionists) if you don't provide reasons for your apparent problem with scriptures. Are you scared because you see the ""ancients"" commenting on subjects you thought science had ""discovered"" since the ""enlightenment""? Man, how arrogant can you get? You remind me of the Pharasees. Arrogant presuppositions are no substitue for confronting your ignorance my friend. Either explain how the Bible speaks accurately on sophisticated subjects as given above, or don't bother posting."
103	1	a	Hmmm, a mere human-mother cannot make decisions concerning her own body, but you, sk8joyful, can usurp the position of God and tell another human, especially a mere human-mother, what she is allowed to do with her body.
104	1	a	Me, too. I'd probably throw in some counseling as well, just for starters.
105	1	a	Including the mentally ill, those with previous violent felonies, and children?
106	1	a	"And here is the crux of the matter where I think Libertarians are missing it: As one Founding Father said, ""There can be no liberty without virtue."" Someone else once said, ""Intemperate men can never be free because their passions give rise to their bindings"".   If the God of the Bible is right, a nation which legalizes sin and intemperance loses the favor of God. And when the sins of a nation reach their fullness (in God's eyes), that disfavor can turn to judgment (Genesis 15:16, Deuteronomy Chapter 28 - ""The blessings of obedience and curses of disobedience). Therefore, while many of the Libertarians mean well on liberal social issues, they nevertheless either don't see the big picture, or they don't believe it will occur."
107	1	a	If it isn't so hard then why haven't you found it yet? I am still waiting and you becoming cocky is not helping you.
108	1	a	Good point here, because the media never insults right-wingers....emoticonXRolleyes   I don't think anybody is denying that Imus' comments were tasteless and offensive. The point that is being made here is that he has the right to make such comments. He didn't discriminate against anyone. He simply said something stupid. If this is going to be considered a crime, we would all be locked away.
109	1	a	Well then, using just the Bible, what is the value of pi to the third decimal point?
110	1	a	"Nice spin. Would you have preferred ""the civilized world"" instead? Or Western Civilization or Gay Western Civilization? Your preference? One case in 1959 isn't a pandemic."
111	1	a	Oh spare me the condemnation ya' XXXX-hard. You aren't interested in saving souls. If you were, you would bother to have payed attention to the countless times you have been told that your abrasive, insulting tactics DON'T WORK.   Plus an eternity in hell or an eternity with a terroristic God? I think I will stick with being able to live with myself for even today, let alone an eternity.
112	1	a	The fact that you think the 9-9-9 plan is good only proves you are as stupid as Herman Cain is. Maybe you and Grover Norquist can get with Herman Cain and start construction on Utopian dreamworld, and don't forget to stop by and pick up your other dumbass Ron Paul on your way .
113	1	a	This just goes to prove that these nasty gays are maliciously infiltrating the military far more than we suspected (anyone would think they want to defend the country or something). But no, they just want to infect them with nasty squiggly crawly things. EEeew!! Look the SEALS must be a bunch of raving deviants. Quick, club the lot of them before this thing spreads.emoticonXRolleyes   Er . . . *puts down burning cross and slinks into shadow*
114	1	a	"He didn't pursue the ""master race of white Protestant."" He was a pure Aryanist, genius one. The very least you could do is get your facts straight, but you probably like spreading this bullcrap on purpose. (Seeing as how you're an atheist.)"

116	1	a	And you're accusing him of not debating properly? That's the best you can do?
117	1	a	You mean like how you suck any rationale thought or discourse from a debate topic? Talk about ABORTING.
118	1	a	I thought you had vowed never to post in this forum again. ????? I suppose with your views on divorce, your wedding vows have as much weight as your vow not to post here.
119	1	a	"Wow that worked well. Please explain where his logic is flawed in the point he made. You cant, because its not. This just proves how much this ""point"" along with all your other arguments have ""flaws in logic"" if you will."

125	1	a	Um no... It's the truth... Um, I guess it was sarcasm, but I don't think that would be something that you would understand.
126	1	a	I suppose if you Truly Believe its not dishonest to repeat anothers ideas as if they were your own. I will keep this in mind the next time I have to write a paper. Woe betide any professor who accuses me of plagiarism, for he is trampling my religious freedoms!
127	1	a	Pure conjecture on your part. As a father of three, I have as much vested interest in my kids as my wife has. To suggest otherwise is BS. But, maybe you don't understand that because you haven't walked a mile in a father's shoes. emoticonXRolleyes
128	1	a	I feel a No True Scotsman coming on. Should I even bother to mention Hovind?
129	1	a	I won't waste my time with trolls here. Do you have anything useful to say?
130	1	a	I see you've met my stalker. Lovely soul, isn't s/he? ;)
131	1	a	That's like looking at a rainbow and insisting it only has the color red in it.
132	1	a	Actually, breeding horses and donkeys isn't an effort to create a new species. Where did you get such a thoughtless idea. And neither is interbreeding lions and tigers. However, you don't seem to be aware that neither ligers or tigons are sterile. They are capable of breeding with each other or with either of the parent species. And then there are polar bears and brown bears, which can and will interbreed if given the opportunity. And the offspring are perfectly fertile.

Did he not fall from the sky and break near all his bones when the wheel well opened for landing after a lengthy flight at 35,000 feet? Do I have to give you the flight number and type of airplane in order to get my stuffed animal circus prize?
136	1	a	Well are there 4 or are there none? What about the Archaeopteryx lineage, why do you keep avoiding the question by changing the subject? It's no wonder scientists get annoyed with creationists.

139	1	a	Already busted, Mr. Trebor. Went in one eye and out the other. Come back when you have something other than generalized rhetoric.
140	1	a	He wasn't trying to. Shooterandproud may be an unreasonable gun nut, but he accepts evolution.

144	1	a	So which argument do you want to stick with/ The one above that says the black vote was irrelevent or your previous argument in which you claimed was significant. I'll refresh your memory::
145	1	a	Well, we have our head in the sand in more ways than one.
146	1	a	You are so FUN. Its amazing to hear you say this considering how much you applaud a law that pretty much allows this in Arizona.

149	1	a	I have no problem with them preaching against gays in their churches and the privacy of thier homes. Its when they crawl out from under their rocks that I have a problem. I also have absolutly no problem what so ever with them talking about Jesus if only they would keep to the subject of Jesus and leave all gay issues alone. Unfortually Paul has replaced Jesus in many churches.
150	1	a	Aaahhh, so just not accomplishing our goals and going home is not defeat, there has to be paperwork for it to be a defeat. Gotcha.

But thanks for judging me. I welcome it. :p

156	1	a	"Don't forget that he's the anti-Christ and wants to starve Seniors and ""babies"". That's part of the DNC mantra too. emoticonXRolleyes"
157	1	a	Yes, we should have a speedier route to the needle. If we miss a few, send a few innocent people to their deaths, no harm no foul.
158	1	a	You are, in effect, telling me that putting someone in a position that will inevitable leave them dead does not make you responsible for their death. If I fire a bullet at your head, while that bullet is in mid-air, I am no longer doing anything to hurt you, and you are fine. However, I have set in motion affects that will result in your demise. This makes me responsible for your death.
159	1	a	And the scientific papers don't. The problem here is that creationists don't read the scientific papers. In fact, most can't even understand them.
160	1	a	Oh what a shame! Especially if it's true! Where did you get the idea that ID theory is not based on evidence and/or testing?

167	1	a	If I ever need a kidney to live, I know who to tell them to harvest from... whether or not you agree to it :P
168	1	a	Yes when not hailing jesus, he likes to leave droppings here and there about the boards ...
169	1	a	"Nice try. Now, tell me how atheists are paying for ""Christian benefits""? Do Canadians give money to people based on their religion? They surely don't here in the States. I can only collect SS if I pay into the system. My employer AND I pay for my family's healthcare. As for their tax-free status, I would have no problem removing it...just as I'd love to see the ACLU and other crackpot liberal organizations lose their tax-exempt status. emoticonXGood"
170	1	a	Oh vey! Vat du they say about the U.S. Marshals service committing more crimes than people they have actually arrested for a crime?
171	1	a	So you are an expert in this like you were about the economics of sending money out of the country?  The problem with letting people like you call the shots is that you really have no idea what you are talking about.  It's something I see in a lot of conservatives.
172	1	a	Yes I apologize for your ignorance and your inability to 'get it'....
173	1	a	But in all reality an embryo is inside a uterus, living solely through a placenta and a two month old baby is not. That is a significant difference. One may argue how significant, but it is silly to say the only difference is time.
174	1	a	That's good - so you no longer believe all actions that result in inevitable deaths are killings, only cruel ones. This is an improvement on your previous:
175	1	a	Yes, but if true it would certainly make the investigation go easier and the repair of other bridges faster and cheaper. Ban gay marriage - your bridges never collapse - imagine that!
176	1	a	And then you can go pat yourself on the back and pretend it's all better. I hope your personal comfort level will be worth the havoc that will be brought upon the lives of women.
177	1	a	That is the greatest monologue in the history of Earth. Instead of a resume, I will just fax this to my next prospective employer.   Great stuff.
178	1	a	When's the last time you heard of someone being killed by the accidental discharge of a fire extinguisher? Or when the last time a fire extinguisher was stolen from a home and then used in the commission of a crime? And don't you think the likelihood of being in a car accident is greater than that of being required to shoot someone?
179	1	a	You seem to require a slick answer to a complicated question - so how about this:  Question: Was Stalin a communist ?  Answer: That's what he said he was.  Hope this is glib and vacuous enough to meet with your exacting standards.
180	1	a	I'm sorry, did Article V have a clause I'm missing that says you can only amendment the constitution if it accomplishes more freedom? Is there anywhere in the history of that provision that supports this? Can you point to ANYTHING that supports your incorrect viewpoint?
181	1	a	And isn't it time that the Bush haters on the opposite side of the argument quit spreading lies about the constitutionality of the law? I'm sick of unsubstantiated liberal blather, aren't you? emoticonXRolleyes
182	1	a	So all of this ballyhoo and really you've changed nothing? emoticonXConfused   The entire system of inheritance and wills would still be in place.
183	1	a	Except for, ya know, like the whole Old Testament.   False testament: archaeology refutes the Bible's claim to history
184	1	a	Hey that cheeseburger is on me,and make sure it has extra  rat poison!
185	1	a	Yep, so much for a pastor knowing his sheep(le).  It's no wonder that they aren't noticed when they go missing.  What ever happened for the shepherd going out and seeking his lost sheep to bring them back to the fold???  As to this case.  I mentioned earlier about Rick Warren (author of A Purpose Driven Life)...he doesn't have armed guards in his mega church.  But, then again, he's not a fleecing WofF in shepherds clothing who seeks to ravenously devour a flock.
186	1	a	Come on down to skid row with the rest of us 'lower class' I'll even buy a bottle of MD 20/20 on me.
187	1	a	The last known passenger pigeon died in 1914. Your attempt to inflame the discussion fails on the grounds of utter stupidity. Might as well be asking if he bagged a tasmanian tiger, or a chupacabra, or the mothman.
188	1	a	Well if you already know you're for guns, then you should know the basic reasons, right? Or was this an uninformed decisions (I heard from my friend that guns are good)? But basically other people have said it. They're protected by the Constitution, they generally result in lower crime rates, and they can be used for defense as well as hunting. Oh, but the burden of proof isn't on the people supporting guns, but those who wish to ban guns. Most arguments for banning guns are easily refutable.
189	1	a	The vast majority of scientists do not believe in Creationism, and all those people you listed who say there are only 2 varients evolution or creationism--they are't anthropological or theological experts. All they know is their westernized view. Their opinions have no reflection on Biology in that sense. THey should stick to Biology. There is only 1 true way--that's evolution. THe other's are wishful thinking, whether they be the primordial flood, the divine parrot, or magic god who made people from dust.
190	1	a	Do you think that red herrings and strawmen will help your case? ;)
191	1	a	Well nobody has turned up the Ark have they, termites could assure that if properly used. After 40 days and more they would be ravenous.
192	1	a	they held a big bash in honor of sluttish welfare queen Ayn Rand:
193	1	a	Oh, I think you take delight in spelling it out in excruciating detail. Otherwise, you'd reply on point.
194	1	a	And you know he is NATO's boy how? You get a bit more looney with each post there comic relief. Keep the laffs coming tho.
195	1	a	Good, associate yourself with him. After all, having a best pal who weaves a web of contridictions and lies can't hurt you right?
196	1	a	Who is this god you speak of? Can I call him? I have some things I'd like done and he can just say them while on the phone I'm hoping.  -Mach
197	1	a	Oh but he is different in the mule's tiny mind. The Southern Baptist types are Christian and so uphold the mule's way of life, so it's alright for them to call for mass death.
198	1	a	So, in your scenario, Prototype, are you anti-choice folk going to force us who believe in choice, who believe that a woman owns her very own body, are you going to place us in re-education jails so that we, too, believe that a fertilized egg is a human being?
199	1	a	"No. I'll type slowly so I don't get ahead of you this time. Follow with your finger and move your lips if no one is watching. Scientists get to define what they mean by the scientific words that they use. Not you and not your preacher. Do I get to define what you mean by the word ""prayer?"" Why not?"
200	1	a	"Hang in here everyone, Bassman's been reading ""_____""'s posts over and over and they've got him talking about the ""American Holocaust""! emoticonXBanghead   Until you have been in my exact situation, I wouldn't expect someone like you to understand. I really don't give a emoticonXCensored if you think it is selfish or not - it is not for you to judge."
201	1	a	No, but I read some of the evidence and it looked pretty solid. If this person was sentenced to life in prison without parole would you question the verdict?
202	1	a	Look what is talking about insane, immune to reason, a prisnor of his own giant ignorance, slavery fetishist and one of the comic relief 3 stooges. You might have a dialogue but then insult isn't part of one. No one gives a rat's patoot about your opinion. If it were your country maybe they would but I doubt it. Mean while eat your heart out as you rail in fear about us buying and keeping arms.
203	1	a	But how can we make rules without legal lines in sand? At least its better than an illegal line.
204	1	a	I thought it was at the bottom of a large body of water.
205	1	a	Death might not bother you, but the afterlife is going to be a real killer!
206	1	a	Dude, you only figured that out now?   I'm disappointed in you.   just joking. Everything he states has a hidden agenda.
207	1	a	Are there many liberal democrat left wing thinking born again Christians? Weird huh?
208	1	a	I can tell that you dismissed the post below that. And I feel I can assume that you didn't read it. Odd that a paranoid conspiracy theorist / communist who concluded that communism has never led to dictatorship should accuse me of being a fanatic.
209	1	a	Really?! Wow! You must know only hardcore pro-lifers. I'm a pro-lifer who believes in birth control and I can rattle the names of about a zillion others who share my opinion. emoticonXWow
210	1	a	And you have a right to cling to superstition and magic as true. But that doesn't make mythology true.
211	1	a	"Your definition of ""Godly wisdom"" is agreeing with your political positions and your spurious theological justifications for them, so it's hardly surprising you don't encounter any liberals who you think have ""Godly wisdom"""
212	1	a	Funny, I thought Heribert Nilsson was a botanist. Don't let little details like that get in your way though.
213	1	a	"Here you are using the misogynist POV. No ""Rushspeak"" if you please."
214	1	a	"Why doesn't this apply to Soviet Russia - which had a population of similar size ? Presumably, your answer would be that the USSR was less ""developed"" than the US ?"
215	1	a	"April was ""recent"" ? Please provide evidence from the memo of these ""examples""."
216	1	a	No need for further evidence why this law would be dangerous to those who do not think exactly like you do!   Instead of calling it a government terrorist watch list, we should just drop the pretension and call it what it would be come. The Democrat Political Enemies Terrorist Wish List! :lol:   Bloomberg: Deny Second Amendment to People on Terror Watch List
217	1	a	Oh, it gave me quite a shock when that happened! I wasn't expecting it at all! emoticonXRolleyes
218	1	a	You just had to bring Godwin into didn't you. >_>   Besides what good is a corpse? Nevermind you're never going to understand my logic so I might as well not waste the time.
219	1	a	Oh . . . please be gentle with me. Whew! :p
220	1	a	Well then the courts must be insane. Because I'm sure there are some gun control laws that they're struck down due to their ineffectiveness.
221	1	a	"How do they use ""the empirical evidence prove it"", when they do no research, and no evidence actually supports their ""theory""?"
222	1	a	Fundies don't say do as I say, not as I do. We say do as God says, not as I do. There's a huge difference.
223	1	a	Oh! Goody! At last someone who wants to actually discuss evolution instead of mythology!
224	1	a	Poor little poopie.   If your gay sex agenda wasn't of the devil himself you might be better received in the world.
225	1	a	If science deals with how information is gathered, different ways of analyzing, and different hypothesis, then it involves worldviews. The base for the worldview of a sizable part of the population should not be excluded. Maybe in Saddam Hussien's Iraq, maybe in communist Russia, but not in the United States.
226	1	a	It ok if one persons bottle is bigger or do they kinda have to be roughly equal in size? really.
227	1	a	With a standing president breaking the law to 'protect' you, this should be expected.
228	1	a	Was that so hard? Anti gay Christians do want gays to oppose their, marriages, discriminate against them, oppose christians from being able to adopt, and practice thier religion. Since anti gay christians are doing all these things to gay people then that is how they want gay people to treat christians.
229	1	a	Would it be the lawless Cardinal Law officiating at one of the funerary masses for JPII and otherwise serving in a prominent role in all the pomp and circumstance surrounding the pope's death?
230	1	a	Then what's Mississippi's problem? They must be run by a-holes because they are being forgotten.
231	1	a	"Really? Then why did you start off your little rant by admitting that ""...microevolution cannot be reasonably disputed."" Evolution has been observed, and that is a fact. Speciation in both plants and animals has been observed, and that is a fact. Apparently you don't know what a theory is. Might it not be wise to learn just a little about science before you make yourself look so foolish? Theories explain facts."
232	1	a	Really. Have you got any quotes from them endorsing monopolies?
233	1	a	Appears a lot of sensible folks are investing in their 401G and 401A plans ;)
234	1	a	I didn't know neanderthals like you and Mr. Grimm had the social graces to know what to do with toilet paper.
235	1	a	But you still feel they have the right idea when it comes to firearms?
236	1	a	...? Either you've misread what I said, twisted what I said, or you're just stupid.
237	1	a	"And we all know when you say ""We"" you mean your buddies the Mormons and their Money are the ones voting down such bills.. It's just a matter of time before people start to wake up. Once they realize they've been duped by an invisible man they'll do the right thing and give gay people their rights."
238	1	a	I'm a redneck because, unlike you, I believe in self-determination?! emoticonXWow
239	1	a	Oh. Then you're just a dupe rather than being dishonest. Your information comes from a moonie. Funny that the Discovery Institute doesn't mention that. The fact that he decided to study biology with the express purpose of disproving evolution. So he had made up his mind that it was wrong before he undertook to find out what is was. Wells was encouraged by the Rev. Moon. He is known selective presentation of data.
240	1	a	Numbers don't lie, unless they come out of the mouth of a Politican.
241	1	a	You're lying to yourself.. So I'll just keep letting you know until the cloud of delusion dissipates.
242	1	a	Deliberate deception would be putting million year old dinosaur bones on a thousand year old planet. Even more deceiving would be putting vast amounts of oil here as well which takes millions of years to create. I would put the stars in the sky in the same category as this in terms of deception. The stars could be more of a cosmetic thing as far as God is concerned. He could have just added them to our sky without concern for whether it made sense or not. I personally wouldn't fault him for this.
243	1	a	Actually the defending of ATF wouldn't do much with regular guns since they have little to do with them. ATFs function is with NFA guns, which you probably know little, or nothing about.
244	1	a	Because there couldn't possibly be any undetected illegal gun trafficking, could there be?
245	1	a	WOW and the republicans would never do anything like that now would they.......They would never impeach a president over a BJ now would they?
246	1	a	"Where is your ""proof"" that a magical being in the Heavens created us ?"
247	1	a	If we could rub a brass lamp, make three wishes and fix our energy problems immediately, I'd agree with you. But since we live in the REAL WORLD, we must become OIL INDEPENDENT while we are perfecting and building an infrastructure of renewable energy sources.
248	1	a	Yeah, right, JO, socialist countries are Eden Mecca's all over the world today. No matter how many times they fail, its proponents just need another chance.
249	1	a	Oh my goodness, yes. I had forgotten that scenario. How silly of me.
250	1	a	So you see a cop on the streets, you see he's armed, that's enough to induce aggression and violence, possibly cause you to hurt others, simply because you saw that somebody else was armed?
251	1	a	"Oh, I get it. So you believe, but you don't exactly ""believe""."
252	1	a	Thats nice...Care to make an argument, or are you just op-eding my viewpoints?
253	1	a	I thought God forbid them to eat dead cows, or was it poultry ? emoticonXRolleyes
254	1	a	And posts like yours serve no purpose other than to detract from the subject at hand. The subject at hand involves how some people choose to fear the law-abiding and feel safer with the law-breakers. You've done absolutely nothing to dispute these facts and prove them wrong.
255	1	a	So you disagree with Zardoz then? True christians are those who profess faith and bear false witness? True christians are those who are ignorant, vain, boastful insulting liars?  Interesting...
256	1	a	The truth hurts doesn't it? They are anti my morals, anti my family, anti my equality, anti my america, and defintely homophobic and I would add one more bigot.
257	1	a	I am here right now brady. Doesn't look like you are doing so well. All of your claims and propaganda points a simmering ashes just like your .org soon will be. Have you got any useful skills so you can make a living? emoticonXHoho
258	1	a	I thought the almighty expressed his will in the Bible for mortal men to know it...
259	1	a	I am not the origin of anything....I originated in my parents....from where did they originate?
260	1	a	So you are saying that genetics has nothing to do with genetics?
261	1	a	Yeah, there are quite a number of dumb Republican bureacrats running Califorhia.
262	1	a	lol Seriously boring is right. Just think, no Larry Craig scandals.
263	1	a	Well personally I tend to always question the intelligence of someone who believes that that a cosmic Jewish Zombie who was his own 2000 year old space god father can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master, so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib-woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree...
264	1	a	So you are pro-life and you hate liberals? Actually Republicans are being liberal in this case (liberal=bigger government, more laws).   But I'll assume you mean Democrats on this. What if the baby is a democrat? If it's a democratic parent it's most likely it will grow up democratic and one more person to attempt to keep abortion legal.
265	1	a	I'd lo9ve to test your hypothesis sometime by dropping a few Democrats into a pack of wolves and seeing who survives. emoticonXSmilie
266	1	a	Last time I checked most state boards merely set the guidelines, whether or not they are followed is something entirely different. Still the fact that you have a board of education spouting such ridiculousness is pretty damn amusing.
267	1	a	Abstinence until heterosexual marriage isn't encouraging heterosexual marriage?  I've never heard of an abstinence-until-domestic-partnership program. Perhaps you could point us to an inclusive abstinence-only program somewhere.  Perhaps not....
268	1	a	So that's what, at least 4 lies in 8 days? Pretty impressive Archie. You should be on your knees asking god's forgiveness for your lies.
269	1	a	I did, you rejected my evidence with your usual excuses. Now, tell me about the big bang.
270	1	a	"Good- we were tired of you not responding or saying, ""it isn't worth my time."""
271	1	a	Do you have to work at becoming so scientifically illiterate? What ever happened to the creationist chant about evolution being a product of pure chance? You seem to chant all of the other creationist tripe.
272	1	a	Only if you include the fact that while cleaning up the water he is beating the pipe with a hammer.
273	1	a	"Oh, ok, I can be politically correct if it makes you feel better. How about I refer to them as ""intelligence deficient"". And I was really not referring to bona fide ""retarded"" individuals (those with true pathology). I agree that there is nothing funny about that. How about I refer to them as people who drive like XXXXXX...Is that better?"
274	1	a	I've been a fan ever since your first fake hairflip goodbye. emoticonXGood
275	1	a	And where, pray tell, does your un-'ignorant' system of proper behaviour come from?
276	1	a	Oh, I think they ought to creat this superstate and we Americans will REALLY have a big laugh. Go for it. I need the levity.
277	1	a	It was a hypothetical question that has been answered..please try to keep up.
278	1	a	Really?!! I'm not aware of any kids being born to two gay biological parents (unless one is a lesbian and the other a gay man, that is).
279	1	a	I did not know that Obama was of low IQ and a conservative, for he is most assuredly a racism and bigot.
280	1	a	So you support allowing a 10 y/o to buy an Uzi and carry it into a federal court house or school as long as he does not commit a crime? Wow.   And your logic about taking criminals off the street and then having no gun control concerns would be perfect...if we had a finite number of criminals. We don't. New murderers and theives and carjackers and dope dealers and bank robbers and child rapists are born every day.
281	1	a	Do you know why gay sex sinners refuse to repent? Because they have an idol - gay sex.
282	1	a	Yes, it's been supressed. Only 14 people knew it before some brave soul tortured them until they confessed the horrible truth!!
283	1	a	No I think YOU are the imbecile. And it's great to see you follow your buddy EZ and his ways.. I suppose you've been training with him for some time now.. You're almost identical twins .. give it a bit more time and we won't be able to tell you apart.
284	1	a	Really, can you show me this science? You are just as genetically similiar to a white person as you are to an embryo.
285	1	a	How about this explanation - you're reading WAAAAAY too much into your precious Bible.
286	1	a	gooey cute as this reads, how is this relevant to the philosophy discourse?
287	1	a	Yeah, the lesbians. emoticonXRolleyes It would also mean the end of the human race. emoticonXGood
288	1	a	"Which is why 50 million Americans are uninsured, including 9 million children. With 27,000 from that group dying every year, as a result of ""freedom"", and unpaid hospital bills the leading cause of bankruptcy and homelessness. Also for the other 50 million who are underinsured."
289	1	a	Dear Jill:  P.S. Remember, I gave you the morning after pill? Use it! Or hey make a few thousand dollars and donate it to research (cha-ching)!!  P.S.S. Thanks for the herpes! emoticonXGood And you think you have a medical problem, all you have to do is take a pill and you're done with the situation I gave you, but what about the situation you have now given me???   What's that (new) quote: All is fair in Love, sex and war? emoticonXKill   Jack
290	1	a	Kudos to Dubya! I thought that Brown was, well I don't know, INCOMPETENT!
291	1	a	And yet the species that exist today are the exact same as the species during the high oxygen content? That makes little sense. It's like saying the world was vastly different before yet perfectly suited for the species that exist today. That is COMPLETELY nonsensical.   Where did all of the oxygen go?
292	1	a	"I believe Alan Keyes already have used that term on us.   (Alan Keyes, the ultra-concervative Republican Candidate for the Illinois Senate seat - in opposition to Barack Obama. The Maryland resident the Republican party had to recruit because they couldn't find anyone else in their right mind who would go against Barack. Also the very same Maryland resident/Television talkshow host who beratted Hilary Clinton for moving to NY and expecting to be able to ""represent"" NY'ers. Yeah, look who's the hypocrit now.)"
293	1	a	That would be the fault of you rather than us. Everyone knows a small mind can't see what's beyond it's comprehension level.
294	1	a	Hmmm.... your religious predecessors would have sentenced you to house arrest for something so heretical.
295	1	a	What case? You don't have a case, or a leg to stand on! emoticonXRolleyes
296	1	a	Then God should have used someone they trusted and respected to deliver that message. emoticonXRolleyes
297	1	a	"Because we have different experiences than you and are more educated on the subject. The only ones who tend to ask ""Why do you feel you need a firearm to protect yourself"" are the ones who've never faced such a situation and don't know what it's like to be in such a position."
298	1	a	Back in 1967, societal view of marriage was opposite-sex. Wait ... it's STILL that way. (Seen the ballot initiatives around the country?!) The point is that letting blacks marry whites didn't fundamentally redefine marriage, because it was still between a man and a woman.
299	1	a	So theistic evolution is not a belief, not a faith at all? It is simply a humanistic idea that is based on science, using God to fill gaps?
300	1	a	Not the same thing at all! Most gay pride floats are moade of crate paper and glue guns. Not gold. I think you have stratched this one really far. Nice try, thanks for playing. Try again soon! Wow, nicotine cravings make me a mean person!
301	1	a	Oh dear, deluded philisopher nutter alert. No one can empirically prove anything. Fact. End of discussion.
302	1	a	Watch out, Jim. She believes that the only good man is a neutered man. emoticonXIc
303	1	a	WW, are you talking to yourself?  If not, then please learn how to attribute statements to the person who made them.
304	1	a	"No, this is the point of the 10th amendment. Article 1 Section 8 applies to Congress...the 10th amendment grants all powers not listed to the states or people.   The 14th amendment is not the ""federal government can do whatever"" amendment."
305	1	a	Hey, someone has to clean our toilets. This may sound brutal, but one of the biggest reasons why Indians, Asians, etc all are heavy on education is because their lives sucked. They didn't get a education and they were living in poverty. Thus, they seem education, mainly the sciences and the maths as a way to escape poverty. Japanese and Chinese parents are massively strict on their kids because they want their kids of excel as the parents either were poor or grew up poor and know what that's like. This may be necessary for these religious homeschooled folks to find out. Spending a life time in poverty or working 3 jobs to make ends meet will change someone's view point on education.
306	1	a	ROFLMAO! Nice way of restating the 'inaccurate' statement basically the same way.
307	1	a	So biology didn't exist before the theory of evolution was formulated?
308	1	a	"And this coming from a so called, self proclaimed ""rational christian"" ? It appears you have blown your cover as a poser by showing your true colors as an anti-christian atheist and a hatemonger. Thanks for revealing your true Nature. emoticonXGood"
309	1	a	Hollow bones however when equipped with wings allow for greater flight distance.
310	1	a	LOL! Aye, Lad, you're lucky that I'm not in my Berserker mood today!
311	1	a	Most certainly. The fact that you think that it is unnecessary only underlines your ignorance. Why don't you discuss beetle lungs for us. Those are organs necessary for the survival of both bears and cheetahs. How about livers. Same story. Thyroid? Pituitary? Pancreas? Go for it.
312	1	a	Your extremist views are surfacing. It's likely you'd rather follow California into the pits of wierdism.
313	1	a	"Oh, i thought ""bullet"" was some sort of slang term. Never mind."
314	1	a	Ok genius, explain to me how come it is that I dont believe in monsters, in ghosts,in luck,the tooth fairy, the easter bunny, and so many other things that a lot of people believe in, but yet I believe in God. Do I have some deep seated delusional fantasy or something like that. You seem to be wise and all knowing( maybe all powerfull as well). Yep, im convinced you are a legend in your own mind. You believe what you will, and I will do the same, and in the end we will see who is right and who is not.
315	1	a	"I just linked you to it. (You do understand how amendments work, yes?) Note the ""to lay."""
316	1	a	Except that the government was tapping phones, and isn't interfering with freedom of speech. But if you ignore reality, then your parallel kinda works, I guess.
317	1	a	"Hardy, har har! It is nice to see sinjin is still ""hanging"" around :)"
318	1	a	So, Steeeeve, I take it you are not for a FAIR society?   Is an unfair society a moral society? Please explain. I find it difficult to comprehend.
319	1	a	Why not, after all, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. emoticonXRolleyes   Waxy
320	1	a	Well, either the real or imaginary Phyllis implied those things in the post under discussion.
321	1	a	Well, you got that one exactly right. I didn't bother to watch your video. It was pretty predictable coming from you - personal attacks on creationists. I quoted YOU because of what YOU said.
322	1	a	"If we did not have criminals, we wouldnt have ""shoot outs"" as you so call them."
323	1	a	Ever see someone try to kill you?that can causes paranoia also.emoticonXRolleyes
324	1	a	I guess I SHOULD give you some time to mourn, so go back and dry your snot
325	1	a	Interestingly everyone but 'the left' can assimilate what is being said, however, the left is notorious for their ever-present attitude that everyone else is mindless. You don't got no brownie points.....
326	1	a	I see. So you actually reject all of science and still are willing to use a computer and the Internet. Don't you know that you are being led astray by your IBM processor?
327	1	a	"If you can't prove or deal in absolutes, then the basis of your argument, the ""absolute"" nature of logic, just became pretty shaky."
328	1	a	"How about you post all the "" Great Amount"" of evidence concerning the Gospel Mythology. The fact that you don't even bother to read the actual information and form an argument tells me you have nothing......"
329	1	a	I think that might mean that you should shut your trap about other people and not pass judgement on them (i.e. Carl Sagan right here in this topic, etc.). What do you think?
330	1	a	But AA's not responsible for that, because he is an A-rab.
331	1	a	Hey Matt, if that paintbrush were any broader, you could paint a room in just five minutes
332	1	a	>_> one would think pulling the power, breaking into someone's house, and having raped her once and been reported would have been proof enough.   What do you want a video of him raping her or something?
333	1	a	You mean other than the fact that Mr. Pocketwatch and Mrs. Pocketwatch don't meet up for a night of whoopee and end up with little baby pocketwatches some time later? How about: I know that humans manufacture pocketwatches.
334	1	a	Kill or be killed, survival of the fittest? No compassion, the rule of tooth and fang? WOW, color me impressed!
335	1	a	Great job straight out of the leftard playbook. Can't refute the message so go after the messenger. Would it matter if it was printed in the NY Slimes, I doubt it.
336	1	a	So being easy to know makes it good? methinks that's not quite right.
337	1	a	I suppose Piltdown Man was the product of newspapers, cute indeed!
338	1	a	"Yet another non-response. (We're not going to have to start counting these, are we?) It fails to address your dilemma of the ""just are"" theories."
339	1	a	I've decided that I will answer this question once and for all if someone can prove to me why people need tennis racquets. If someone can answer this for me, I will attempt the definitive assault weapon response. Have at it.
340	1	a	So do you think that the earth is hundreds of millions of years old?
341	1	a	You mean you're for real? You're not setting out deliberately to make creationists look as if they don't know what they're talking about? Because that's all you're achieving.  Still no source for the trillions, I see.
342	1	a	"I was under the impression that he was referencing the video...since he always interchanges the words embryo and fetus I just rolled with it.   Secondly, an embryo does have instructions for a brain...while a plant does not. I guess the answer hear depends on the ever evolving definition of ""mental existence""."
343	1	a	You mean you are as biologically ignorant and as easily refuted as the thread originator? Yes, we knew that already. Why all the big letters?
344	1	a	Oh no. The main disagreement between theistic evolutionists and Fundmentalists is that Fundies aren't worshipping God, but a false idol of their own making.
345	1	a	Yeah yeah whatever and there are gay catholics also. The point is that the vast majority of baptists are the <term that has been banned>
346	1	a	You mean Priests? Because I hear the ladies are crawling all over them, can't get enough of that catholic loving...
347	1	a	You know, I've seen this BS from you quite often. Is your life sour? Do you need to make other peoples lives as miserable as you can just so you can get through the day?
348	1	a	how about small cute animals? whare is the line of what religion allows, and law forbids? we know it is not where harm comes to another person, or poligamy would be legal
349	1	a	And refusing to donate your resources is killing, so I have killed someone by not donating my blood etc.
350	1	a	"So, is a giant Panda a bear? Or some other ""kind""?"
351	1	a	Interesting, this is the same type of angry rants that Capo used to post on the abortion debates before he was banned. How interesting that you should get so angry and worked up over such an innocent exchange between me and chloe.
352	1	a	"You would say that, because you are neither a woman, nor gay. Families were ruled by the husband with a clenched iron fist by the way, and women and children had few rights. The family structure was ""secure"" that way. Yes, the fact that there was lower teen pregnancy outside of marriage, is just such a good thing in and of itself. This meant fewer people burning in hell, which is what is really important.emoticonXRolleyes"
353	1	a	"I actually agree. Make it legal and sign away your rights. However - there are plenty of fathers who opt....... ""Deadbeat Dad"" is practically a profession."
354	1	a	A tenth grade education? Why am I not surprised. That explains why you swallow this evo dung, because it makes you feel smart and enlightened. It is the most popular form of intellectual masturbation for the uninformed and pseudo intellectual today; not to mention the religion of the Natural Man. And here's a clue for you buddy, don't believe everything you read on the internet. Try using common sense before swallowing this tripe and if you want to exercise your common sense muscle, go back and reread all of my posts and try to answer all of my questions objectively. You know, those questions that you and every one of your compadres have completely ignored and not attempted to directly answer at all.
355	1	a	"I am just passing on what I seen personally. I am not trying to prove anything. Just sharing an observation.   PS...from ""our"" point of view? You got a mouse in your pocket? Please explain."
356	1	a	I have an avatar? And I wasn't born in 1990. Remember what the say about assumptions...
357	1	a	and you shouldn't forget the thousands of gays incinerated at this death camp!!!
358	1	a	Quote Mining. You got to love it. Always fascinating when stuff is dishonestly taken out of context. Normally, we see this from creationists, but you are by no means the first prolifer who has engaged in this practice. But lets look at it
359	1	a	Agreed, and the vehicle they will be riding in will be the Prosperity Express.:)
360	1	a	There are certainly more people who think that species evolve from earlier species than there are than people who think species evolve from later species.
361	1	a	You know what I find amusing here...your entire argument revolves around how it will affect your wallet. Forget about the lives of the people who are denied rights in this country that you take forgranted. That is the true christian-American spirit isn't it? Oh how proud our forefathers would be if they could see us now...oh wait...most of them owned people...nevermind.
362	1	a	And it seems that the only thing that repulses you is religion. Curious... emoticonXRolleyes
363	1	a	If that's the case I wish someone would unplug me. I'm getting tired of this version of reality.
364	1	a	It's only obvious to the delusional ones, as I did not lift it from anyone. Just stating the truth. If it hurts, tough.
365	1	a	Waxy, don't you have better things to do than cruise gay threads. ;)
366	1	a	And I didn't have to choose to be homosexual. It is a natural inclination. I chose not to hide or lie about who I am. However you are the one who seems to be under the delusion that being gay is a choice. Once again I ask you if it is just a choice then you choose to be gay this moment.
367	1	a	Oh come on. If those words were hateful, then you need to 'investigate' probably millions of people, because those are pretty normal sentiments. Canada must have a LOT of tax dollars. I don't entirely agree with what he said either, but I think it's downright scary that your govt. investigates something like that.
368	1	a	What is it about the same piece of paper you do not understand?
369	1	a	Well, Jews have always been indecisive. Like this joke says:  Q: How many Jews does it take to screw in a light bulb?  A: 4; 1 to screw it in and 3 to argue about which way it turns.
370	1	a	Right, what I think doesn't make you naive or delusional, what you think does.
371	1	a	Oh, but it does mean something to him. He can't/won't say what, but it sure isn't based on homophobia, no siree! It's just really, really important that marriage stay a striaghts only club, for reasons that can't be explained, but there's no bigotry, don't worry on that score. emoticonXRolleyes
372	1	a	You mean the guy who didn't tell his own cabinat he was going to Argentina to go get a little.. and left a power gap because no one knew where he was? You mean that guy?  That is a heck of a lot worse that actually having an affair. Eliot Spitzer at least had the decency to resign when he got caught being a hypocrite.   I personally don't care about his diddling with some woman.. although it does make him a hypocrite since he ran on the 'family values' campaign. It's that little thing about leaving his duties behind without communication that is the real destruction the public trust.
373	1	a	Exactly my point! After four pages he finally gets it! Give him a hand! There's a brain in that head after all! But my point is, that unless you do disagree with the stats, your argument is irrelevant.   [QUOTE]What I have been saying for the last three pages is that your question is idiotic, as you're comparing things which are completely different in function. They are not analogous.
374	1	a	Why is it that people don't want to admit that it was Bush's' reckless spending on a War that we didn't need , the tax cuts for the richest 2 % of America, The Fact that under Bush they had to ADD space on the Debt clock, not to mention that he was as dumb as a rock, yet they can place all this blame on Obama who inherited this mess and has done more to get us out of it than Bush or any Republican would have done. Unemployment is High, we know this, but it was on it's way up when Obama took over because under Bush more corporations left this country , more businesses closed down, the Banks were allowed to do whatever they wanted without regulation of any kind, and yet none of it is his fault?.. Enlighten me...
375	1	a	"Somebody needs to check his Little Golden Dictionary. ""Random"" and ""selective"" are antonyms. To say that selection is random is to admit ignorance of the English language."
376	1	a	Yeah, lets tax those rich greedy jerks!!! I mean really, why be equal when you want something for free right??? SCREW FREEDOM I WANT MY HEALTHCARE!!!
377	1	a	Well he can defend his tax difficulties by claiming he is a creationist and thus cannot be trusted with quantitative processes involving a bit of mathematics. Then again he can tell IRS that GOD will provide and they should contact Bush to get Gods cell number. I am sure that IRS, GOD, and Hovind can work it all out.
378	1	a	But that is a misunderstanding of what the big bang theory is. What it isn't is an explosion. I don't suppose you have actually studied any astrophysics or astronomy upon which you base your rejection of the big bang, have you?
379	1	a	He certianly is better educated about things like that than certain evangalic christians.
380	1	a	The question is do the dogs want to be protected ? Those poor dogs, for all you know they might prefer death.
381	1	a	Two answers: they were either of the ant kind and didn't eat wood until they underwent hyperevolution after the landing of the ark, or they were placed in a suspended state of hibernation by 'Awlmighty Gawd' (only two - one male and one female, in spite of the fact that termites don't actually propagate that way). It is, after all, the word of Gawd, as revealed in the wholly babble.
382	1	a	I did not say that I thought that, that would be putting words in my mouth. Sure they'd have access to the report... Sneddon probably had his grubby hands on it ASAP. So what if the investigation was done by private investigators? If Sneddon did it, he would plant evidence... he probably did that when they searched MJ's house. Oops I mean... the government NEVER lies. emoticonXWow
383	1	a	"Can you say ""OVER GENERALIZATION""? Can you say ""UNJUST STEREOTYPING""? Can you say ""LIES""? Can you say ""MISINFORMATION""? Can you say ""MUDDYING THE WATERS? Can you say ""JAAAMAN""?"
384	1	a	Maybe you can talk when you provide us with the actual translation.
385	1	a	but you too are a figment of my imagination, and you only think you are a giant alien dreaming about this world because i imagined you as such. you cannot disprove this either.
386	1	a	Damn, takes some real gonads (wait, you're a Lib, so scratch THAT one) to claim the power to get inside the minds and hearts of the masses...a protest by Conservatives MUST be racist, but a protest by Libs is pure and righteous, correct?
387	1	a	if you can find an impartial judge, i'll take you up.
388	1	a	No, Archangel, if it wasn't done with a gun present any murders committed do not count. In this case, one armed person could have ended the slaughter so quickly it would be incredible but the blood dancers still could have had their day by celebrating that the gun put the children at risk more than the knife murderer and no telling what else they could say to dramatize the situation by claiming that guns were banned there and THAT person broke the law so off with his head...after they harvested his body for useful organs that is.
389	1	a	My house evolved over millions of years. it built itself . Prove me wrong. emoticonXRolleyes
390	1	a	Because all scientists hate god. Again, this is a fact.
391	1	a	Because the gay personals are full of married straight men looking for discrete gay sex
392	1	a	So, do you spend all of your days as an Obama shill? You have two posts, both anti-McCain. I hope Obama pays well. emoticonXRolleyes
393	1	a	Yes. So you are indeed committing the genetic fallacy. And apparently unaware of the semantic ambiguity of the sixth commandment. Thanks for clarifying.
394	1	a	Proof for a non-event? What century did your purported non-event supposedly occur, Einstein?
395	1	a	On the other hand abortion is only opposed by the born and wars are started only bu the born and choices are made etc etc etc etc.
396	1	a	"Which is why the ""medical establishment"" endorses smoking, drinking heavily and a fatty diet, with no excercise, because they believe we are predestined by our genes, right? Why do you persist with these blatant lies?"
397	1	a	"Your ""opinion"" was a kindergarten question outlining a ""problem"" that never existed, a ""problem"" that was explained to you 3 or 4 times. How is it our fault that you ask such embarassing questions repeatedly, despite having the answers explained to you repeatedly? How does this reflect poorly on anyone but you?"
398	1	a	But yet you have the right to make an an a-s-s out of yourself? As far as the nude beaches go, it would be worth the plane fare if I knew you were going to be at one so I could laugh my a-s-s off.   FROTFLMAO
399	1	a	You said there wasn't a pro-choice group before Roe v Wade. However I would have to do my research to dig up a group in 1850. Hold on...
400	1	a	I dunno. Those Priuses are so small inside and out. How much explosive compound could Hasan fit into the thing and still be able to get in and drive it?
401	1	a	Well, you certainly defended this video, Archangel. How interesting to now hear that you were defending material you hadn't even viewed.   But I'm not going to do your homework for you. It's on this thread; jyoshu posted it. So search his posts on these pages.
402	1	a	And so you have it... Socialist lunatic fringe view that human lives are only worth what the government says its worth....
403	1	a	This is begging so many darn quesions it's boggling my mind!
404	1	a	Quite True. I guess those are pretty useless. I suppose His Noodly Appendage works in mysterious ways.
405	1	a	###!! You're seriously advocating allowing kids to take guns to school? Don't you have enough greiving parents already without giving kids the option to shoot out a disagreement?
406	1	a	Those damn black people! All wanting respect and equal opportunity! They should just be happy with what they got!Why should they work for the same pay? They are just selfish! [/end sarcasm]  This argument is tired *yawn*
407	1	a	"Have you EVER read anything that Dawkins wrote? Any of his books? Now didn't you tell me that I shouldn't be so ""self-confident"" about the Bible because you thought that I hadn't read it? Can you spell hypocrisy? I knew you could."
408	1	a	"Cheerio and thanks for the examples! Yes these are perfect examples of animals creating ""unnatural"" things- I happen to be thinking of Beavers and their dams but hey, thats just me."
409	1	a	Considering what you turkeys did to the State of California, with its budget and social depravity, you have no room to talk. I'm surprised the Lord hasn't cast San Francisco and L.A. into the Pacific Ocean yet.
410	1	a	You forget, that all those nice rewards? None of them are rights.
411	1	a	The IDEA isn't a bunch of bull, but our implementation of it does leave a lot to be desired. Too bad Jefferson wasn't immortal!!!
412	1	a	I agree, it is pure genius...especially how it has infiltrated politics and governments. emoticonXBanghead
413	1	a	Nothing anyone has said has proven anything I have said wrong in any way because all you have are unprovable and unproven assumptions. Now go over to the other debate Creation versus evolution like a good little boy and you will get my response to Tiktaalik. Nkaaaay?
414	1	a	Ah! So wellspoken for an addle-pated twiddle poop! I congratulate you!  And a total lie! Who the Hades wants 13-year-old children to be sexually active? No responsible, thinking person could wish such a thing. You malign Planned Parenthood.  You have ceased to be a credible commentator on this issue.
415	1	a	I note the bolding but the reason for it is as inscrutable as the peculiar form of what appears to be English which is used.
416	1	a	Give them a bus schedule or are they too good to ride public transportation? Can they carpool? There's always a solution to temporary transportation problems and it usually doesn't come from Uncle Sam. emoticonXRolleyes
417	1	a	You actually have some full insight into gays and what we have gone through and think were pathetic. Once again insults and a bigoted view Archie. You never cease to amaze me.
418	1	a	Sounds like a lot of ***Bull*** to me. bah du bup. BTW, Sammy the Bull spelled his name Gravano, not Grevano. emoticonXRolleyes
419	1	a	For one to have evolution as their foundation belief, means that one cannot be certian of anything.....
420	1	a	In other words you would wait until we were attacked again before doing what is required. If we vacillate and wait for the nuclear cloud it will be too late. It amazes me; utterly amazes me, at how strongly felt the left believes in the good will of bin Laden and the terrorists to clean up their act. Just amazing. But with Bush? Noooooooo. He's ALWAYS wrong and never right. Isn't that about it?
421	1	a	Yes, but an adult asking such a question is not capable of understanding the answer. ;)
422	1	a	Please be sure to give that message to all the criminals out there. We wouldn't like to have the situation where all the law abiding citizens got rid of their guns and the criminals kept them, would we?
423	1	a	The Archbishop of York has a screw loose too on that subject.
424	1	a	Oh please... You just refuse to acknowledge anything of a victory for LGBT people.
425	1	a	Repent, you Christ-denying, gay bashing radical heathen.. well, you already are going to end up in the Pit.
426	1	a	It's not often you see such a golden opportunity handed to you on a silver platter.
427	1	a	V.P.C. once again I am shocked and awed. Why no mention of our fearless atf's  and the agents they caused to be killed. And all the Mexican citizens they have caused to be killed? Oh wait if the vpc did that it would be kinda like jumping outta bed with your partner.  SPECIAL NOTE: Some ATF agents are fearless.  Drug War Victims Drug WarRant  These are a few of the one known about.It works both way's Brady and more our way much more.
428	1	a	Born again? Pardon me for getting it right the first time. ;)
429	1	a	You do realize you just disproved your own basic points yes?   The pictures you posted are falsified because abortion clinics and small health clinics contract out to places to have their medical waste incinerated.   Good job on failing to realize you just proved Cunx correct.
430	1	a	Wait until Gen. Petraus' report comes out, then you'll eat those words. BTW, do you take ketchup or mustard with that? ;)
431	1	a	you always run and hide behind Bryan like the true coward you are
432	1	a	So now you want to demonstrate that you are also ignorant of the fossil record?
433	1	a	emoticonXRolleyes Drink Kool-Aid often?   No major party in the US supports the mass murder of an entire race of people.
434	1	a	So this time you are really serious about leaving emoticonXRolleyes   So now mental existence isn't good enough (as it is not unique which was my point) but human cells is important and something of a human brain. Well what importance are human cells and a human brain? It seems the idea of a human having importance is not just limited to me...you just happen to add another criteria at the end that you feel is important as well.
435	1	a	Who is Allah, Alex? Great, I'll take 'things a terrorist god would do' for $1600 Alex.
436	1	a	I didn't think you had either the intellectual or logical ability to respond. :)
437	1	a	"I wonder if I can convince a judge that all other legal documents should be read in an ""enlightened"" way. I can perhaps get out of contracts and speeding tickets if I just show them the light and error of their ways!   Your supercilious post amazes me."
438	1	a	Well actually I have not seen your point of view expressed anywhere but on these forums. Seems to me if its rising to ascendancy at least ONE scientist somewhere would have recently at least mentioned it. Quick search reveals NO mentions at all. Of course if you say its displacing NDS then I guess I will have to agree - you being a well known biologist and all, but I remain perhaps a bit irrationaly skeptical.
439	1	a	Contribute? Oh please.... Take your crying act somewhere else. Like I said no one is buying your Bull anymore....
440	1	a	Yeah, and we all know what happened when they did that with Galileo. emoticonXRolleyes
441	1	a	Ah yes, adopting the Nazi Germany policy of encouraging neighbors to snitch on others, to reward tattle tails for violating the trust of others and invading privacy.
442	1	a	I'd argue that the woman wants to control who lives or dies. That's scarier to me. emoticonXRolleyes
443	1	a	Oh you do love to do the psychological technique known as 'transference' don't you...or is it 'projection'???   You are so obsessed with gay sex, I would not be surprised if you and Ted Haggard have a lot to talk about.
444	1	a	"Sheesh ! What a way to bring goodwill to all people in the world, ""yearning"" for democracy. And if I remember right Saddam was our toady during the first Reagan Administration. Hmmmmmm, wasn't George Herbert Walker Bu$h our Veep then ?"

446	1	a	So wait, Phunting's good deeds will get he or she a higher position in heaven...but (Phunt, what sex are you?) he or she is going to hell anyway...gotta love Christian logic.
447	1	a	"About a third of the weapons seized in Mexico were referred to the U.S. for tracing; approximately 11,000 out of 29,000.   About half were successfully traced. Better than 90% of those to U.S. dealers.   Of course your definition of ""minute"" might differ from mine."
448	1	a	"No, they don't. Creationists do. ""Why haven't all animals turned into humans?"""
449	1	a	Right. I'm damaged because I'm not a Christian wing-nut. I'm still looking for at least some refutation.
450	1	a	You your qualifications in logic allow you to judge that? I suspect that you are talking out of your elbow since I haven't seen any evidence that you know what logic is. Mostly I see hysteria and superstition in your posts.
451	1	a	Flip back to page 9 and do try to keep up.   I am not going to spam the board for the weakest link.
452	1	a	On the evidence, that must have been where his brain was located.
453	1	a	Do try to keep up with yourself. People like you are always talking about how we need gun control laws in response to the crimes taking place. But you have absolutely no answer for what to do when said laws are violated.
454	1	a	You are just playing dumb, right? There will be fewer technicians and fewer orders for equipment PER INSURED. Their pay will not be cut. There will be fewer of them PER INSURED. Initially the absolute volume will increase.
455	1	a	How remarkable. What a singular idea to invent a contest of skill in which a person in opposition tries to prevent one from outperforming them. Is this the only type of game in which there are two sides, or is this a novelty?

457	1	a	"Did you go to college, Trebor? You might want to look up how ""pedophilia"" is spelled. LOL!! Then you can go have a beer with Orion and watch his head swivel."
458	1	a	Use some common sense, would you. And while you're at it, trying reading! I said, and you quoted me as saying:
459	1	a	Gansao, don't be bitter because of what you had to do with a producer, all those years ago, to get your act onto the Gong Show.emoticonXClown
460	1	a	Ha! There are a lot more gay owned and straight non-homophobic or non-religious businesses than that. Thanks for the cheap and clueless stereotype though!
461	1	a	"You know I actually considered that. Too much work, though. I have added to my list of things to do when I retire. That is, of course, assuming that we turned things around by then. If not, I will likely be too busy ""holding the fort"" against the hordes of starving yuppies."
462	1	a	So it's alright for a Evo to insult you and go off on a tangent, and expect to get answer. What's the point in answering if your being mocked, before you give answer. Now I know why there are few Creo's on this forum.
463	1	a	Even Joe the plumber abandoned the garbage scow? Say it aint so!
464	1	a	"Winning any political election has never been about electing the ""best"" man for the office, it simply means you appeal to the majority of people that showed up to vote. Smartest and most popular aren't necessarily the same person, if you went to school you probably remember that. ;)"
465	1	a	VoR is about as Catholic as the Archbishop of Cantebury. I'm curious about what I'm right about though, seeing as I asked you whether you think that medically un-necessary abortions should be legal or not.
466	1	a	I though the torture was just a result of the number of wing nuts there were around the place.
467	1	a	"And you can be described as a ""pre-dead corpse"" as well. Histrionic revisionist linguistics only serve to push some form of dishonesty agenda that can not stand by itself on the facts. It is the coward's route. Are you a coward???"
468	1	a	Oh, I agree....private security companies are the answer. Very republican of you.
469	1	a	So, faith and argument from incredulity.   If you find it impossible please state exactly what part is impossible. Then maybe an actual scientist could take over.  Major in molecular biology? Not even a full degree; not like your going to doing anything original.
470	1	a	Ah yes, the Might Makes Right principle. Mob rule. You are so fond of it I have to assume that you assume the mob is always going to agree with you. Poor, naive soul...
471	1	a	First off, your sick. To actually want to see more death and destruction.  Are Americans somehow less intelligent? Your notions are racist for lack of a better term. What to meet stupid? Walk out your front door and sample the people on the side walk. You'll find the same stupid around the world.
472	1	a	"Even then, your statement does nothing. They aren't ""getting themselves pregnant"". A doctor is doing a medical procedure, that may or may not result in a pregnancy (ya know, those little sperm thingies?) emoticonXAngel"

476	1	a	No, no, no. If humans were created 4,000 years ago, then the earth was created 4,000 years and a few days ago. At least try and get it right.

478	1	a	What part did your real daddy play in it? Will he be on the island, too?  This is a good example of a scant level of maturity. Your simple out for various arguments is to play the idiot/XXXXX card.  More and more each day I see you as a complete waste of oxygen.
479	1	a	Well, I suppose creationists would object to careful definition of terms and the assiduous distinguishing of fact from non-fact, wouldn't they? It runs counter to all they hold dear.
480	1	a	And, let's see, when did the job loss actually start?   Oh yes.. We can trace the troubles starting in 2007, with a big melt down in August/September of 2008. Let's see.. Obama must have been a terrible president to have caused that.. oh WAIT. That wasn't Obama, that was BUSH.. Excuse Me.
481	1	a	You know something is wrong with this world when people attack the act of posting an opinion (that of Ms. King) and another condemns the idea that someone may read it and develop their own opinion. Saving lives is not just a Republican goal. And yes it is an act of desperation. All acts are an act of desperation when it comes to saving the natural process of life with out interference of those who place their comfort above the life inside them.   Whatever is wrong outside the womb, is not the fault of the inhabitant within the womb.
482	1	a	So Simone, if the shooter had instead driven his Toyota Prius into a crowd, killing many as a result, would you call for banning Toyota Priuses?
483	1	a	Well as long as you ignore the evidence, why do you need proof. Blind faith works just fine.
484	1	a	Are you suggesting the pollsters are bias? Nooooooooooo, that couldn't be. You think they were trying to sway the election? Noooooooooo, that couldn't be.   These guys along with their Hollywood and music industry buddies are lossing their base. They need to go back to movies and music and leave the politics alone.
485	1	a	You mean the Conservative tilting Supremes donot know the law ? You want to tell them that ? emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken
486	1	a	Anything to get around doing things the normative way ... emoticonXDonno
487	1	a	I must agree with Sarge about the homophone,could that be why Mr.Obama appears to stand tall from your view?emoticonXCensored
488	1	a	That's what's known around here as a lie, and I wish you were capable of feeling ashamed of yourself.
489	1	a	I'm sure the response is that He could. But, y'know, God's a real XXX sometimes... (Besides, who do you think used His uber-complex biochemical engineering skills to create the prions responsible for FFI, anyway?)
490	1	a	Well good at least you are aware there is no reason beyond your opinion of morality against gay marriage. So by all means don't marry a man and the problem is solved.
491	1	a	Thanks, for giving me the balls. I didn't know you were trying to convert me. So, because I don't believe what you want me to I'm retarded. You know I could say the same about you, it works both ways. You see I don't want to convert you, all I'd like to see is you open your mind to other possibilities. Adios, Arrevideci
492	1	a	Very Interesting! After only 33 posts Mintaka already has the political and gun advocacy priorities of individual members here down pat; or should I say the resurrected antonia, our resident National socialist healthcare freak does and couldn't help but expose her personal insights where none should exist for this alleged newbie.
493	1	a	So you're claiming the beardy bloke nailed to a couple of bits of 2X4 didn't actually exist?emoticonXRolleyes
494	1	a	"And have a child with a terminal disease and watch them most likely die slowly because of my ""soul mate."" Yeah. I'm thinking if they're willing to make me go through that they're not a soul mate at all. >_>"
495	1	a	oh ok, so I assume you don't live in your own house? I was trying to picture over 61 people fitting into one house. :)
496	1	a	"Spoken like a true Conservative, not one of those liberal ""compassionate conservatives"". emoticonXGood"
497	1	a	I'd be curious if Berkowitz studied whether a sword or club produced the same effect as a firearm?   Short of castrating all boys at the onset of puberty, I'm afraid boys will be boys.
498	1	a	We have a terrorist supporter among us, objecting to restrictions on terrorists! Why do you hate America?
499	1	a	And ill continue to have pity for abused and unplanned pregnant women lacking basic healthcare.
500	1	a	Doesn't surprise me lets all jump ship and put our heads in the sand... Even more of a reason I should run for public office :p
501	1	a	Sounds like a movie... We could threaten to use our old nukes on all the potential enemies...oh, yeah, we've already done that.
502	1	a	Well if no siege comes, I guess no harm no foul.
503	1	a	You're the one who needs to get a grip. Lots could get worse, but not for the reasons you're stating.   But I take it you're finally admitting that (actually) 50 million uninsured human beings who could die or go bankrupt is a big problem.
504	1	a	"There you are NATO, you have justified a Final Solution for the ""Mexican problem"". Let me quote you"
505	1	a	Did the bill include burning heretics at the stake, stoning them out of the village or removing a women's right to vote?
506	1	a	Here is a mind blower. Maybe they are celebate because being married to Jesus they are saving themselves for sex with him.
507	1	a	Then you would want me to be something god did not create me to be? Silly, I 'd say! Humans are part of the animal kingdom. Mammals if I remember from biology. Are you not an animal? If not, maybe the mothership will come and pick you up soon.
508	1	a	Really? Well, when I have a kid, I'll be sure to just leave it in the woods, since it can apparently care for itself.
509	1	a	It's Satan, not Satin. And he's your daddy, not ours (John 8:44).
510	1	a	No, you shot off a smart remark while failing to address any of the issues. Par fro the course for you. It seems like maybe you would be more comfortable on a blogging page than a forum page, especially a blogging page without a space for reader responses.
511	1	a	ah but freedom of speech has many limitations. Since liberals are opposed to American principles their speech can be considered treasonous. No country can survive if it allows itself to be undermined. Lincoln went all out to preserve the country, we should do the same things by making liberals illegal.
512	1	a	"Kinda like, ""Don't speak of the speck in your brothers eye when you have a plank in your own?"" :p :p   The scary part of this insane reality is that there are a LOT of whackos that think just like and actually support Pat Robertson. And I would venture to say that 98% of them who voted, voted for Bush. Ha! There's one born every minute.   Perhaps this might clue some folks in, as to the concerns the folks have on the left, as to the direction this nation is headed? Or, then again, maybe not. emoticonXRolleyes"
513	1	a	Oh, Mrwriterman made a funny. I guess not all gays are humorless. :)
514	1	a	Public policy? Takes waaaay too much thought. Now one can go to ballpark here and pay $8.50 for a half pound hot dog, smothered in thick layers of chili, cheese and grilled onions (2,200 calories, 55 grams of saturated fat, 1,600 milligrams of sodium). That's a no-brainer (literally).  Dono
515	1	a	Balderdash! Atheism isn't science. That's nonsense. And science is atheistic in the same way that plumbing is.
516	1	a	OMG SO TRUE!!! Two of my friends chose to be asian, my mom chose to be a woman, and my PE teacher chose to be black. OMGZZ@! YOURE SO RIGHT!!!
517	1	a	Yeah.. caught that... But, hey.. I think you made a mistake.
518	1	a	Hmm maybe I should take that one to a local patent office...
519	1	a	"Funny how people who are ""for"" capital punishment don't see it that way..."
520	1	a	First of all a man cannot terminate tissue he isn't carrying.The father can opt out all he wants but when that fetus becomes a born person he is responsible just like the mother is.
521	1	a	Oh yes yes... never mind the thousands of lives destroyed, the shame, the guilt, the anger, the fear and all the while perhaps being in a combat zone and having that stress...  Never mind the hundreds of millions wasted retraining new people because we kicked out perfectly able people because of their sexuality...   All you can do is sit here and spew non threatening bunk to try and scare people and make your bigotry somewhat tangible to your warped mind...
522	1	a	Can't you come up with your own line? I really did not think you would see the bucket of worms that would be stirred up if gay marriage was lawful but I tried to give you my best shot.............I did not even mention the income tax implications if this was allowed............
523	1	a	How about the pass that the Clintonistas routinely gave to Bubba for his Oval Orifice tryst with Monica??
524	1	a	Yes but of course was that rreally a consious choice? I see sarcasm but no real answer that is credible.......seesh if I wanted srcasm I would have watched the Orielly factor. (oh wait thats yelling and bicering) knida like politics! (oops sarcasm hehe)
525	1	a	ROTFLMAO. The guy is more like Bush than I realized.   Come on, Easy, if you have never tried pot or XXXX, you are in the minority.   Nobody cares.
526	1	a	with tens of millions of gun owners, and hundreds of millions of guns in the US, and you think the guns are still the problem....
527	1	a	"Unriggable, your statement should read the so-called ""pro-life"" since they are anything but."
528	1	a	And that's why I think you are a troll. There really aren't any experts here. There are several who are knowledgable in a variety of topics, but that knowledge seems to me to be the result of being both educated and widely read. It also indicates an ability to reason and an open mind.
529	1	a	Perfect. A creationists caught repeating the same refuted arguments on different forums. Resistance is met, run like a coward to another forum.
530	1	a	Methinks it's rather obvious that mintaka is JimIrvine because no rational newbie would come here and agree with Irvine's ridiculous and juvenile attacks/assertions out of the box. emoticonXRolleyes
531	1	a	A woman's right to choose to keep her legs together is not in any way abridged by this bill. Ho, ho,f***ing ho.
532	1	a	how about a Swiss University? they have full automatic weapons in most homes, and target shooting is a national sport.
533	1	a	Plenty of examples,law abiding citizens are shot by criminals daily.However the O.P. is about police going off the edge.Oh did I mention that some of those law abiding citizens sometimes shoot the criminal trying to kill them?
534	1	a	Is this another attempt of yours to paint all that believe in smaller, less-intrusive government as loonies? Very transparent, sorry. :(
535	1	a	Society highly values the creation of future taxpayers, especially under deficit-spending socialist presidents. :p
536	1	a	You're deluded, as usual. Anything that doesn't balance the budget is based on LIBERAL THINKING. And you don't balance the budget with massive tax hikes and gutting the military like the liberals are fond of doing. And you're going to vote for liberals? Obama? His latest budget plan was defeated 414-0 in the House. Not even his liberal cohorts would vote for it. And you vote for Obama? What the hell is the matter with you people?
537	1	a	"Not nearly as tired as the ""YOU can't live like that because it is against MY religion"" argument. Hell, that one pre-dates Christianity!"
538	1	a	And yet we're still waiting for your mental condition to finally hit you like a ton of bricks.... Denial is the usual reaction...
539	1	a	You put such confidence in articles written by partisan plebes, using unsupported, irrelevant links to make the printed text pseudo-intelligent. I cannot imagine you holding your own in a serious debate.
540	1	a	Tell us, Steve, now you've been thoroughly snowed (again) by the GOP, how's the weather up there in CloudCuckooLand?
541	1	a	You can believe what you want, your beliefs are not relevant to the issue.
542	1	a	...but you are just fine with marijuana smoke huh?  I am working on the assumption that you run home to tell mommie or you run to find your teacher and report it immediately. Midgets like you got to have some backup.  How and why do you always change the subject? Can't take the heat? Do you ever read headers?  You got a mouth on you as big as grand canyon.
543	1	a	I can neither confirm nor deny at this particular juncture that I may or may not be either male or female. :)
544	1	a	Apparently in Marc9000's small, small, small world, if you're not a Christian, you're a atheist.   Thus over 4 billion people are atheists. emoticonXAgree
545	1	a	This is great. You mean none of the Davidic line ever copulated with women to produce their descendents? LOL!
546	1	a	You will soon learn, my friend, that fundies have very, very short memories when it comes to refutations of their arguments...
547	1	a	I guess cheer leaders are the new tough guys and gals!
548	1	a	"That's the difference between liberals and conservatives (AKA ""real Americans.) Conservatives have a sense of humor. Liberals don't."
549	1	a	Ah the Pinhead element of the tinfoil hat brigade raises its pointy head.
550	1	a	I thought that the most commonly accepted date for the alleged birth of Jesus was in 4 B.C. Assuming the current calendar really were keyed on the birth of Christ, how could Christ have been born Before Christ?
551	1	a	You mean your hypothetical I presume? Murder violates the rights of the murdered by relieving them of their life. That's why it's illegal.   You're a bit slow I see.
552	1	a	How does this address your claim that the Second Amendment served as a defense against a tyrannical federal government? Are you moving the goalposts now?
553	1	a	Of course God would have something to offer to lowely peon, but that doesn't explain what use God has for lowely peons, except for doing stupid pet tricks.
554	1	a	You and your spiritually-challenged friends are obviously too stupid to understand the difference between a cult and Biblical Christianity.
555	1	a	so you're one of the many people you got question 1 right emoticonXIdea thank you...thank you. You are the many reasons why the US is still standing on its foundations and not collapsing into senseless ignorance...THANK YOU! :)
556	1	a	so you think it would be ok to fire people for being secular atheists?
557	1	a	Anyone who can read the entire page will find that Zeus is in there, but since you apparently can't read I forgive your ignorance.. emoticonXByeemoticonXBye
558	1	a	Like the crusades and the inquisition? How about the Southern Baptist Convention, formed at the end of the Civil War with the express purpose to discriminate against blacks? And of course, the KKK and the Aryan Brotherhood make the same claims as you. Of course, you're going to tell me that you are a christian and they aren't. But when people tell me they are christians you aren't always around so I just never turn my back on them. That way, even if they are follow that strange pull to make a bad decision, I will at least have my eye on my money.
559	1	a	Really. Some people would think I'm in cahoots with the creationists. I predict their behavior and then they go and do it.
560	1	a	And this differs from your cell how? (oh wait it doesn't).
561	1	a	"Well, you did... only that ""you"" then resided in countries like France, Brittain, Sweden, Norway, Germany, Ireland, Botswana, China etc, etc ;).... And yes, we where all racists back then..."
562	1	a	"I typically don't read Antonia's propaganda pieces, so is she holding up the UK as a shining example of dental health? If so, I suggest that she ask a typical Brit to smile, so she can see for herself the folly in such an assertion. The US' ""bubbas"" have better teeth than the average Brit. emoticonXRolleyes"
563	1	a	You are like, so totally noble and sensitive! I really admire your pro-humanity stance. That is going out on limb.
564	1	a	Just because you don't hold the same beliefs as we do, does not invalidate our belief. I feel sorry for you if all you have to believe in is a small petri dish of algae. You do need absolute proof if your going claim it as the only possible way of creation.
565	1	a	LoL What part of a Binding Document, the Constitution with it's Bill of Rights, don't you understand!   You demand that we obey the law, but you would allow Government to break the Supreme law of the Land, and you call me a nut? I gotta say my friend, THAT is truly nutty! emoticonXSmilie
566	1	a	Maybe I wanted it from a source that was worth looking at
567	1	a	That's nice, but have you ever thought of reading your own religion's Holy Book so that you can intelligently discuss what it is that Jesus and his disciples said?
568	1	a	Actually no. You read the article again, and thoroughly this time.
569	1	a	How often to you poke your nose into monkey genitals in order to know that?
570	1	a	Look who uses profane language; And you claim I'm regressing ! emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken emoticonXChicken
571	1	a	Do you have something-other then words from a dusty old book of myth to offer as an explanation?
572	1	a	A gay person is a homosexual, friend. He can't change that part about himself. He was wired that way. If you don't like the idea of gay sex, then I'd suggest you not participate in gay sex. That's pretty simple. If you don't want gay marriage, then don't get one.
573	1	a	Well if it's so easy then how about you provide the names of the dealers who're selling howitzers and anti-aircraft missiles and fragmentation grenades? And while you're at it, supply the names of the companies who're making them in violation of the various federal restrictions.
574	1	a	Well, the French have always been an independent and rebellious lot, not like those staid northern Europeans. And let's remember how much we all owe to those heathens of Greece and Rome!
575	1	a	Like you were raised? Looks like it didn't work and now those hormones must be kicking in? Nothing worse than a menopausal female grinding her ax...their favorite victims? Males.
576	1	a	My article say's this. it needs to be noted the alleged evidence for extensive history assumes uniformitarian geology. Because of this fact, this response adds up to: Your theory doesn't work under my theory, so your theory is wrong. Of course you don't want to consider that fact, do you?
577	1	a	Not the best school system there although the Mayor has a nice car I hear emoticonXClown
578	1	a	Why would anyone want to get to Heaven? Archangel and people like him would be there, praying and chanting 24/7 . Thanks but no thanks!
579	1	a	So, in order to be against gay marriage, a person has to be faithful in his own marriage? Gimme a break. He supports what his constituents want him to support or he doesn't get elected. In case you haven't noticed, the majority of Americans are against gay marriage.
580	1	a	Just as being anti-gun won't compensate for being born with a small brain.
581	1	a	So how are those gun free zones working out for you?
582	1	a	It doesn't take a Ph.d. to understand who wrote the first Gospel. Grade school children can look up who was the first man to walk on the moon.
583	1	a	I see you still don't understand what a strawman is. It is hard to have a strawman when the comment wasn't directed at any particular claim....
584	1	a	Uhuh! And you've got a bridge in Brooklyn you want to sell me. . . .
585	1	a	And I'd hate to let you sneak across your dishonesty, distortions, disingenuous, and unsupported false assertions.
586	1	a	hunter, would you be interested in actually discussing this logically? or do you simply wish to toss out empty assertions and run away when challenged? if your view is the truth, then you have no reason to run.
587	1	a	By your own admission you haven't 'hung out' with stoners for a while and you're making generalisations about them to people who do spend a lot of time with stoners?
588	1	a	Of course anyone can cite exceptions.....did you see the baby? Probably not.......As long as the mother is OK the baby does not count....... emoticonXRolleyes
589	1	a	I don't have to say anything here, your post made it sound sick enough. Yes, freedaom at all cost. Isn't that the theory this country was founded by?
590	1	a	This is odd. You voluntarily participate in a Religion discussion forum - indeed, the frequency of your posting suggests that this participation occupies a substantial portion of your leisure time - but when someone presents you with the opportunity to demonstrate the validity of your position, you 'have better things to do'.
591	1	a	And so goes the fact you're more than willing to let rapists and murderers go free.
592	1	a	Here in Michigan, they closed down the first rest area on I-75 because of the high amount of gay encounters taking place there. Maybe you should poke your head out of your closet once in a while and see what the rest of your community is up to.
593	1	a	Other than the Soldini firearms were purchased legally there is no proof that he had a concealed carry permit. If he had the AP and the rest of the left-tard media (redundancy alert) would still be shouting it from the roof tops. Just because the Brady bunch-VPC says so doesn't make it true. Then what else can we expect from a self confessed torturer of helpless small animals and arsonist?
594	1	a	"""I don't know; just like I do with everything else, I pretend it's not a problem for my indefensible beliefs."" emoticonXRolleyes"
595	1	a	But did you consider it relative when you posted this on another thread?:
596	1	a	"Somehow I seriously doubt that ""Testimonium Flavianum itself"" meant ""from the website by Peter Kirby entitled 'Testimonium Flavianum' that happens to have the text of Josephus' An 20.9.1."" But if that's what you're going with, whatever."
597	1	a	And it remains to be seen if your are. Pick an unreasonable and dumb argument go with it.
598	1	a	I am still waiting for you to tell me why the gay priests only molested boys.......It has to do with how they are physically contructed.........
599	1	a	I would argue against this but I would need to introduce subjectivism into the argument. lolemoticonXCensored
600	1	a	Don't you have that other weird warped forum your posting in now?! Go there with your advice.
601	1	a	Hey Dane, you're real good at calling people ignorant, sanctimoniously declaring everything they say as false, blatantly false, or falsehoods. But would it be too much to ask for you to back up your rejection of berts arguments with anything more than insults? Like some actual facts for example?
602	1	a	Then you must have expected him to be a mute on the show. He was basically just there; he made no worthy comments. It was so bad he had to resort to an emotional hypothetical. He made no sense, and that comment had no part in the interview. Bush doesn't send kids to Iraq. First of all they volunteer. Second of all, they are older than 18. Please let me know what comments Michael Moore made that you thought were worthy. You might have trouble.
603	1	a	Yea I guess you're right, you people tend to blur together after a time.
604	1	a	The first Christians were Jews. Anyone who claims to be a Christian but hates Jews is a XXXXX. An anti-Semetic Christian is like an oxymoron term. And an Aryan is supposed to be someone with blue-eyes, brown-hair, and light-skin. You don't have to believe in 'Aryanism' to be Aryan, and the mortal enemies of Aryans are not Jews. 'Aryans' may hate Jews, but most Jews aren't bigoted. By the way, Hitler did not like just Jews but others he considered 'inferior' to the 'superior' 'Aryan race.'   Do some actual research instead of pulling XXXX out of the air to conform to your screwed up opinions.
605	1	a	No more of a poison than alcohol (actually far less), should we start lacing that with strychnine?   ***I can see it now***  *Excuse me bartender...what are the drink specials?  -We got Bud Light bottles for $4.00, Jagerbombs for $7.50, and this new drink called Convulsions on the Beach. First one is on the house!
606	1	a	What's Sesame Street?... Oh wait that's where you got your pathetic education isn't it, no wonder you're so ignorant. ... emoticonXChickenemoticonXChicken
607	1	a	Im still waiting to find the text book that will show me how to get perfect order out of nothing explodeing!. What we need is theory to revolve around facts not facts to revolve around theory, other wise all we are ever gonna be are unanchored ships on stormy seas!..
608	1	a	"Or maybe they do? Could this sick, perverted individual be the spokesperson for the so called ""gay movement""?"
609	1	a	So, then you DO feel that what you did was a sin. Otherwise you wouldn't have asked forgiveness for it.   I have one question. What was your motivation for starting this thread? Was it to try and somehow prove that a person can be a Christian and have an abortion? Just curious. IMO, you are right that you are forgiven for it, as God is a forgiving and loving God. But I hope you don't do it again.
610	1	a	How about he pulls it out from under the Ramadan tree and unwarps it rather than your Hitler Youth moment?
611	1	a	Yeah, they should only teach the sexual positions the Pope would approve of.
612	1	a	"If by ""We the People"" you mean a handful of self appointed persons with strong financial intrest in the running of the country...   The document is largely a copy of the theories of Montesqieu and John Locke."
613	1	a	You don't understand words; why the hell was I thinking you'd understand numbers? emoticonXRolleyes
614	1	a	Not even Answers in Genesis thinks that these ideas have any credence. But Mr. Kent Hovind still does.
615	1	a	What part of the Christian worldview? A part of the Christian worldview says stealing is wrong, so you must mean stealing is good? A part of the Christian worldview says rape is wrong, so you must mean rape is good? A part of the Christian worldview says sexual immorality is wrong, so you must mean sexual immorality is good?
616	1	a	No, back to school... turn in what educational credntials you feel you have, and just stay at the coffeehouses... at least you have a .005% of hearing someone ineject some truth in one of those sidewalk tete a' tete's you nutters are so fond of... but here you are dead wrong. Have you ever heard of an egg? ever heard of a sperm? An egg is still considered a multiple cell organism, and a sperm as well. You're gonna have a hard time pulling that one off.
617	1	a	"The gentleman (??) in question has been presented the facts numerous times. He ""pooh-pooh""s them as irrelevant. He places himself above scientific research. He doesn't know the difference between unsolicitated testimonials and scientific evidence."
618	1	a	What difference does it make? Do you only care about frequent killings and choose to ignore isolated incidents? If so doesn't that mean that innocent people dying only interests you when it's in large enough numbers that you can try and exploit them for your own selfish agendas?
619	1	a	Very impressive how you argue science. Are your arguments science, or are they anger? When Dawkins argues it with his above statement, that Darwinism is as all-encompassing as God is stated to be in the Bible, is it really science, or is it religion?
620	1	a	And once again (s)he rambles on while responding to nothing said in the prior post. At least you're consistent in your irrational hate speech. BTW, the term sword of truth implies no violence against anyone at all. Except in the mind of paranoid hate mongers, that is. emoticonXGood
621	1	a	Man, you are really enriching this debate. We should all sit and listen to your wisdom.
622	1	a	Yea, at least on earth you get some relief, you die eventually.
623	1	a	"Whatever. First you say no one is calling you a hypocrite, than you say people do it, but it just an attack tactic. If you ever get to a mental state where you can entertain the possibility that a critisism of you can be grounded in reality, than go back to my post where I say ""This is why..."" and give it a read again. Maybe you'll learn somethig. Till then..."
624	1	a	Come on, Aivlis. Give the guy a break. He's just practicing being a grown person.emoticonXHoho
625	1	a	What I posted lays out the 4 conventions if you will just read it, your questions will be answered. I can't read it for you ya know.
626	1	a	In America it's called free speech. If anyone here there, or elsewhere in America doesn't like free speech, and doesn't like a debate forum where the Word of God is found, then they can go whine to their mothers (yo mama).
627	1	a	However, we do give people alcohol, there are many people who drink it on a regular basis who are not addicts. What do these substances you mention have to do with being gay? Would it perhaps be okay for me to have homosexuality on the weekends or after work during happy hour?
628	1	a	It's as much of a point that Phillp Johnson has. Trying to use Philip Johnson as a source about evolution is like trying to use Jack Chick as a source about Catholism.
629	1	a	Well, it's not as though you hold your tongue all that often when it serves in support of an anti-gay argument.
630	1	a	And creationism was investigated and explored completely and shown to be false.
631	1	a	Except, of course, the evidence is totally against that. Plus, there is the little matter of infant mortality... and lack of resources.   But hey, don't let common sense and evidence stop you.
632	1	a	And if there's one thing I can count on, it's your insistence that we can assume guilt and should make a public spectacle of the matter before even investigating any matter.
633	1	a	If you need a decision made for you, ask me. I'll be glad to. Be prepared to raise your child though.
634	1	a	That has to be a typo my friend. If you can compress the EB into only 1012 bits then you can write your own ticket in the field of data compression! Lets see 100 million pages into 1012 bits - fantastic - please tell us how. I really would like to put the entire literature of mankind (and more) on an Ipod.
635	1	a	"Oh relax for cripes sakes. This is the ""fun debates"" forum if you didn't notice."
636	1	a	Oh, so this only happens here, huh? Every single hardcore drug addict is here, huh?
637	1	a	Forgive me. A few minutes with Google ought to give enough info to refute what he said, so I didn't bother.
638	1	a	"And of course, the sea of Montalban's assertions as science, the sea of Montalban's out of context quotes, or the sea of Montalban's misrepresentations of what others have said. It seems that Montalban knows the ""TROOTH"" and won't be discouraged with facts. Sadly, Montalban knows what he believes and reality seems to be irrelevant."
639	1	a	"So the ""Origin of Species"" has more information for theistic evolutionists than the Bible does?? Does theistic evolution believe in Satan?"
640	1	a	"Hoo boy! That target just got larger. You still don't get it, do you? Not a ""slave contract,"" but a covenant, a promise :)"
641	1	a	How do you know if they WANT to believe in a deity? They simply don't.
642	1	a	Man cannot invent anything that did not already exist in form. Did we invent the wheel, or discover the idea? Did the Wright brothers invent machine powered flight, or was it that they stumbled upon it? In every culture, in every society, man looks to something greater than himself. They simple don't leave it at themselves and be done with it.
643	1	a	It's a self-defeating question. You're asking why numbskulls participate in numbskullery.
644	1	a	Like the crazy idea the Earth goes around the Sun.
645	1	a	Horse manure. When did you invent that self-serving rule? Put it back in your ditty-bag.
646	1	a	So what? How long did the idea of magical creation out of nothing in 6 days hold prevelance before somebody actually challenged it scientifically?
647	1	a	No - but they certainly have a bias. As do we all.
648	1	a	My apoligies emoticonXAngel It must have been the testosterone emoticonXBanghead emoticonXBanghead
649	1	a	To bad you don't have the power to define the situation.
650	1	a	well if I don't get an answer here I'll just spread it around the whole internet. Fine with me.
651	1	a	"Are you blind? I was refering to Nancy Pelosi's ""'fair' speech"" policies, not free speech. Fair speech is an attempt to limit free speech."
652	1	a	"To the exclusion of all others? I thought you were working for acceptance and inclusion. You are the only one allowed to ""exclude?"""
653	1	a	Ever hear of artificial ensemination? Why is that heteros only think there is one way to produce children? I find hetero sex disturbing,and an unnatural lifestyle choice.
654	1	a	Yes none of the organs flown in from Africa or India would be farmed from murdered people, would they?
655	1	a	"Well I suppose I could've always put up a sign that said ""Trespassers will be held with legal counsel, robbers will be shot, survivors will be shot again"" but you're just welcoming trouble with that."
656	1	a	Are you jealous because they won't let you out of the institution while gansao get's to run all over the place?
657	1	a	No, it's one of those rare instances in which YOU are on the right side of an issue. :p;)
658	1	a	And the ability to digest nylon is not a new function?? You seem to have a different conception of 'new function' that what matches with reality.
659	1	a	My mistake; I read it wrong. And guess what? I do know what the moon is ;)
660	1	a	Am I suppose to take that as an insult or just a passing remark,hmmm?
661	1	a	I know. Sad indeed. Orion and his liberal ilk make it a habit to come up with these sophomoric ideas. As if Jesus (who is God according to Scripture) would come out and give Moses the commandments against gay sex and then turn around and incarnate as a gay man. Get real. When the antichrist comes he'll probably be gay (one OT scripture alludes to the antichrist as having no affinity for women, and Satan loves to mimic God's kingdom with some kind of diabolical twist.). Then Orion will prostrate himself before him and receive him as his long lost savior.
662	1	a	I suspect a good many monitors and keyboards got cleaned on that one? ;)
663	1	a	And woman's law superceeds both, or hasn't your mummy taught you that little lesson yet Hunted?
664	1	a	Most congregations are expecting to leave the U.C.C.? Where did you see this, or are you making up the news again?
665	1	a	Does this mean that you have finally repented of your multiple divorces??
666	1	a	Mr. Brown was able to attend ball games. Not exactly held captive was he?
667	1	a	Cannot be helped. You make it far too easy. But do not think of yourself as a loser, think of yourself as a student with significant learning deficets.
668	1	a	We accept your forfiet. Two more to go! Once they post, this thread will be pretty much closed. I predict Penfold will go first, followed by Jo. emoticonXSmilie
669	1	a	by this stupidity a KKK mob with guns is a militia!
670	1	a	Did you start the thread in the hope that no one would respond to it ? Is responding to and pointing out the trolling and hypocrisy you have shown wrong ? But I congratulate you for finally admitting that this is a trolls thread. That is more than I expected from you. And as for me reinforcing your contention about conditional christian love ? I do love you my friend, I just hate what you represent which is why I express my love by correcting you and calling you on your every hypocritical contradiction. emoticonXAngel I am Archangel after all. emoticonXGood
671	1	a	"Sigma, I was only joking. It hit me this morning though that if I'm willing to talk about abortion without bringing up God, I wonder if the Pro-Choicers could argue their position without bringing up ""women's rights"". ;-)"
672	1	a	well that won't help you when you go to hell...Woo hoo
673	1	a	The judge should be informed that 'the leading' IDist admits that ID is religion. (yes, I've posted this before...) What else could an unembodied designer, which naturalism perforce excludes, be but a deity? So Dembski's ID has one or more unspecified deities - supernatural, unembodied designers - creating biological systems, at some unknown time, at some unknown place, by some unknown series of steps. What a great scientific theory! :-)
674	1	a	Ahh, pointy tailed devils with pitchforks, more of your menagerie of divvels, demons, saints, angels, demigods, ghosts and other varied superstitious nonsense. Which of your gods created them, Snerdley?
675	1	a	And none of those explanations have anything to do with a magic being who made everything out of nothing. Science should teach currently held theory.
676	1	a	We gotta GET them law-abiders for having the audacity to believe the Constitution's Bill of Rights! Huh Brady!
677	1	a	Well so is falling out of a building onto a piece of rebar. Or getting mashed in a car crash. There are a lot more of those than shootings but you don't seem to care. Why is that? Is it because you love to dance in blood?
678	1	a	Thats funny, because these scrambled eggs sure don't taste like KFC to me.
679	1	a	You mean my dog 'CIgarette'??  I took him out for a drag.
680	1	a	So, all knowledge is ignorance, and all events not in the present are ignorance. I'm not following you here. How about we leave the definitions as they are, so that we can differentate true from false? Calling everything ignorance doesn't move us forward in the debate. If we accepeted your claim, we are typing ignorance and concuding ignorance, so what would the point be?
681	1	a	Yeah, renaissance right back to the dark ages, that is what you a holes did the last time you were in charge.
682	1	a	But the official IUPAC name for acetylsalicylic acid is 2-acetyloxybenzoic acid. Duh.
683	1	a	"You mean the malcontents bred? Oh Noes! Who are the ""we"" who get to do it back, and whose army will you borrow to do it with? the present bunch of obese felons are already struggling to cope with their present duties."
684	1	a	I don't recall seeing anyone who's for gay marriage come out truly in favor of the idea here that I recall. Can you? Naw, didn't think so. emoticonXSmilie
685	1	a	Really? Why don't you go out and start randomly hurting and killing people and see how far that argument gets you in court.
686	1	a	Well, she IS getting her info outta the bible, one of the bloodiest snuff novels ever written lol...
687	1	a	You mean like a tapeworm? Should removing tapeworms be illegal too?
688	1	a	"Actually, no one cares if you believe in god. That is your business since it is something that you take on faith without any evidence that it is true. And no one believes in ""evolutin"" [sic]. The theory of evolution is an explanation for observed facts that has been repeatedly tested. It is the best explanation that scientists have been able to formulate. It is based on evidence and not faith."
689	1	a	That's quite a leap, even for you. How did you know that the officiers were pro-life? Or that any pro-life people would condone the officiers' behavior in this instance.   I certainly think it was excessive. I guess I must not be pro-life by your illogic.
690	1	a	More irrational drivel, and have you forgotten that I am an arab? A smaller minority in this country than blacks? Yet you must play the race card and assume that because I oppose this criminal woman for threatening the life of her unborn child by actually holding her responsible for her own poor conduct that I am somehow a racist. Your argument is as pathetic as your character is found wanting, you immoral apologist for all that is wrong with this country.
691	1	a	So how is the oil and gas agreement with China working out for you antipodeans?
692	1	a	The CIA seems to agree with me. Appears to me that you tinfoil hat is starting to fray about the edges.
693	1	a	"So AIDS is the fault of ""the gays""?emoticonXRolleyes   lol it's been a long time, JP."
694	1	a	And you're a poor replacement for that koolaid-drinking Seer Travis.
695	1	a	and where did they find the participants for this study, bath houses and bars? Gay men are a hidden population in statistical relms. It is very hard to get a true random sample of data on gay men. Studies will say whatever the funder of the study wants it to say. You just get data from the right place. If you want gay men to look like raging alcoholics get your study participants in a bar. If you want them to look like sexaholics then you get your study subjects in bathouses. The truth is that to have honest statistical data you need RANDOM SAMPLES.
696	1	a	Why? Would you rather get stabbed to death for twenty minutes than get hit in the head with a bullet? A desire to have suffering extended - hmmmm...
697	1	a	Being' immune' and being 'less prone' do not mean the same thing.  I doubt that you will become the poet laureate of Dallas if you do not understand words sweetplums.  You are an old camp fruit and a snivelling bigot .  Are we talking daddies? What does an old fruit like you know of daddies?  I bet he's sure proud of you.emoticonXChicken  I wouldnt be proud of having a mincing bigot for a son..must have set his sights low.  Do white men still leave a bad taste in your boyfriends mouth sweetplums?  You are not married ..
698	1	a	Wow, make up your mind. Either populations change over time (evolve) or they don't.   Would your wingless beetles be able to produce wings again if they were somehow beneficial again? You are starting to sound like Darwin and his finches.
699	1	a	Even if winnie the poo could read he simply doesn't have the brain power to comprehend.
700	1	a	"Yeah, ok, keep up with your ""Creationist"" therory and I'll stick to my much more believable idea of ""Evolution."" Keep your religion out of MY Government!"
701	1	a	Good one, Truthsayer emoticonXGood   ...a rich white woman... LOL! Gotta be from Texas. :p
702	1	a	They are the people who dont get their boilers serviced regularly:)
703	1	a	ok, fine, you can use that line, but there is also a moajority that believes in other things. there's this crazy thing, called a choice. we all have that. remember? i made the choice to have sex, you're making the choice to be a total ***hole. we all make a decision, and its the strong ones that stick with them, even though there are others who dont believe the same thing.
704	1	a	I think if that happened, Texas probably will go back to being the lone star state.
705	1	a	Just another bogus reason for having and abortion............There are thousands of them.........
706	1	a	Whatever. emoticonXRolleyes I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill here, but that's up to you.
707	1	a	Right, because besides rape and health concerns these really are the only other reasons women have abortions. emoticonXRolleyes
708	1	a	Superglue! How you gonna make the DNA?  This is all facinating but it doesn't have a thing to do with information theory.  Copying DnA to do reasearch is a neat trick and quite useful.  Is there a point to this?
709	1	a	And Sotomayor argued that the American people have absolutely no right to defend themselves. What's your point?
710	1	a	thats true. i helped. my next bible will be 10 times better if i get around to finishing it
711	1	a	Oh, really?   Translation: the only amendments that rise and fall are the ones that I want to.
712	1	a	Just be like the Jews and Christians and steal the idea! A lot of their mythology isn't original: it was stolen from other people who thought it up first.
713	1	a	What a relief, I would hate to think Batman was so gullible. But Dems, I can understand them thinking that. emoticonXHoho
714	1	a	And if the majority supported banning Christianity would that be ok just because the majority supports it? Civil rights should not be up for a vote ever no matter what.
715	1	a	"Anyone can ""give consent"". The issue is wether the parson is old enough to make that decission. I bet the children Michael Jackson raped gave their consent. Does that make it ""allright""? Are the kids ""mature enough"" to take the consequences of those actions?"
716	1	a	So then I guess you could also debate that algebra serves no purpose as well.
717	1	a	Enlighten me. What evidence came out Monday, Tuesday Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of this week?
718	1	a	Go ahead and toss your Bible in the trash so you can justify your gay sex sin. See if that gets you into heaven.
719	1	a	perhaps you would like to explain simplistic.  Is the anthropic principle simplistic?  What natural law created natural law?  Where did the information come from?  Is matter creating matter simplistic? Matter creating information?  Here;s a deep thought:  If matter created the Universe what if it changes it's mind! emoticonXRolleyes
720	1	a	You mean you don't think you have your own made-up religion?? How interesting! Do you really think you're fooling God? Or us?? Or even yourself??
721	1	a	Wow, you are high on Christ...Scary...I haven't seen this addiction up close emoticonXRolleyes
722	1	a	"Well I guess then it's open season to call all anti's ""CHRISTONAZI"""
723	1	a	Wow, what a group of rude, self important, pompous, pseudo intellectuals who will insult and personally attack a person for one grammatical error. I meant to say the UNIVERSE has aged from 4 to 14 billion years old since I was in school but rather than deduce that you call me dumb and ignorant ? With all of your so called intelligence can you prove the Universe is now precisely 14 billion years old ? Can you prove Neanderthal Man was a human descendant ? because DNA tests dont prove that out and yet PHDs and Masters Degreed scientists insist they are. That's why the bible say's that the wisdom of this World is foolishness to God.
724	1	a	Now, that logic is so bad, it's worse than circular reasoning. It's figure eight reasoning.
725	1	a	And it will, I guess, take an amendment to deny rights to and make a whole segment of the population second class citizens.
726	1	a	Since he's commented on it several times now, and seems to have me confused with someone else, maybe he's channeling a past life or something--who knows? Better yet, who cares? :p
727	1	a	Really? What book is that, because I have seen no quotes or links to any source of any info at all from you anywhere above on this page. So once again accipiter, what in the world are you referring to? You and the obvious child oughta get along fine since you both offer nothing more substantial than personal attacks which are based on your own warped beliefs and corrupted interpretations of that which you disagree with.   Here's my original post again, I challenge you to explain how these alleged stone age sheep herders whom you scoff at and mock described contemporary living creatures which paleontologists today identify as dinosaurs, from skeletal remains?
728	1	a	If they haven't been discovered yet, HOW THE BLOODY HELL DO YOU KNOW?  Ten percent more brains and you'd be pondlife. emoticonXKill
729	1	a	whooooosh. emoticonXBye  That was the sound of my point as it went over your head.  How much do you want to but I don't find any?  Go ahead bet me! Are you afraid?
730	1	a	Well that's a stupid statement. Stupid enough that I can't even wrap my head around it and make a proper comparison.
731	1	a	Oh, but Sina does not live in a womb so she is unimportant.
732	1	a	Somewhere in the middle? I always though it was solidly to the Right. :p
733	1	a	An immaculately presented response, entirely avoiding the topic, or indeed reason, in order to unwittingly further the case for retrospective abortion.
734	1	a	"Explain that one to the thread starter. He claims he is the victim of age discrimination when he states ""I am a person 15 years of age and I want my gun, yet I can't get one. Why not?"""
735	1	a	And how do you know what other animals can analyze? Is that another supreme abilities of us humans? To read the minds of animals?
736	1	a	Depends on how basic they are. Not much call for using flint, steel and tinder to start fires.
737	1	a	Dont mind him, hes just sticking up for his new boyfriendemoticonXLove
738	1	a	And I'm sure you of all people know the mind of God... Please, you just take snippets of scripture, and twist it into well this is absolute. God loves gays and lesbians, but you fling god out as a way to justify your slander and bigotry.
739	1	a	Well then. All of the ex-christians have it both ways don't they. Since they are saved they can lie, cheat, steal and have wild, illicit sex (following the example of several christian preachers).
740	1	a	I dont need a sex lesson from a little boy.  Once again you missed the point( getting to be a habit).  We are talking about behaviour that was condemned by the preacher, one of which was adultery..not fornicating but I am sure the preacher would condemn that too  If you read the link you would know.  If homosexuality is condemned by god then they cannot marry in gods eyes..keeping up?  If gays cannot marry then gay sex must be outside of marriage therefore it is fornicating.  You really should try to use your little head more.  'Lets stay on topic' who made you a mod?emoticonXChicken
741	1	a	There are somewhere between 10 and 20 million gay people is America. 10,000 is a small minority, yes. And even your article admits this number is unsubstantiated, AA. More lying for JESUS.
742	1	a	Yes, because Republicans are the only hypocrites in the government, right? emoticonXRolleyes
743	1	a	Here we go again with the name calling..............See what I mean Justine.......no wonder the gay movement is losing traction in this country........
744	1	a	Anything that doesn't fit your preconcieved prejudices is automaticlly wrong?
745	1	a	Considering what the TOE says, if a dolphin ever gave birth to a chipmunk, it would disprove evolution.
746	1	a	So in your own words the police want to go on murder sprees, because they're armed. According to you the military is just waiting for the first convenient excuse to open fire on anyone, be them designated enemies or just innocent bystanders.
747	1	a	You're a Bush-man, aren't you, gnojek? Come on, admit it. With that stance, you'll be in the White House before sunrise.  (You do realize that I was being sarcastic - right?) emoticonXRolleyes
748	1	a	Yes, that was one of Galileo's more absurd leaps of logic.
749	1	a	"Yeah, so if on my math test, I put ""The answer is 7 because my god says so"" and the teacher marks it wrong, he's the XXXXX?"
750	1	a	Let's allow same-sex marriage only. Then heterosexuals will have the same right to marry someone of the same sex.
751	1	a	Being put in a cell with Howard Dean for life? emoticonXCry
752	1	a	Good point. If she is old enough to be licenced to drive, presumably. If she travels by bus, train or plane, are those companies complicit?
753	1	a	Your own source said the amendments are 11-27. Amazing how the 2A got incorporated into the XIV isn't it without Article V. emoticonXGood
754	1	a	That could also be very effective in a positive manner during political campaign speeches.
755	1	a	You really think so? Im flattered, but I think you are wrong.
756	1	a	Umm I dunno that whole faith thing is kind of important. Oh I get it you were being insulting.... Gotcha.... BTW hows that whole spiritual enlightenment thing working out for you?
757	1	a	Good point. emoticonXAgreeemoticonXAgree The poor guy would be like a midget that got his stepladder taken from him!
758	1	a	You apparently know as much about law as you do about science. You wouldn't be arrested for having someone willingly consume a plant unless that plant was a controlled substance and last time I checked, poppy and weed weren't cancer cures.
759	1	a	Says the one who uses the abortion card when he's about to lose a death penalty thread.
760	1	a	"the same way most people on planet earth dont give a XXXX about american ""football"""
761	1	a	I get the feeling they have filed under: Plague, Avoid like the.
762	1	a	Translation: Muslims are worth nothing. Christianity is superior, therefore they are worth nothing. Let the US come in and kill them, ruin their cities, and take their oil.
763	1	a	"Right, expect when talking about the 14th amendment. The way you guys like to define ""equal protection"" would make it so any restriction is unequal."
764	1	a	Here come the Christians, thinking they can know everything by guessing, and commiting the genetic fallacy left and right.
765	1	a	So the fact that we still have criminals who choose to kill others, should be used against is in determining whether we can be trusted or not?
766	1	a	I don't think it's a cover-up. I think that it's a conspiracy between the black helicopters and the aliens beaming suggestions to those without the foil-lined hats on. :)
767	1	a	Please emoticonXRolleyes Why dont YOU post something thats not one sided and full of non factual evidence that isn't full of spin and your crazy agendas?
768	1	a	In that case a man in a coma is not a person then, is he?
769	1	a	"Ah?""scratching head""I just woke up,what?womens choice,her body,death penalty?ah ok gotch ya.emoticonXFrazzled"
770	1	a	Obviously, in the event of a disaster, George W. Bush sure thinks he has a right to choose.  Hmmm, let's see, should I interrupt my vacation just because people are drowning in New Orleans? Naw, I don't think I should. They're just poor people and they probably didn't vote for me.
771	1	a	Plain with the benefit of hindsight. I love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law. If it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, I'm sure.
772	1	a	And yet it's usually the liberal democrats who are in favor of murdering innocent children...
773	1	a	"Does your use of the past tense ""was"" imply that you've seen a burning bush and been converted to reality? Or are you still an ""anti-american pinko commie bleeding heart liberal?"""
774	1	a	You have no Idea how glad I was that I was sitting down when I read this!!  First it shocks me that you haven't labeled all those who claim to see UFO's liberals.  Then I have to wonder didn't at one time the RCC say we were the center of the universe,... The sun went around the earth,... the earth was flat ?? Theres no one but us .. It was all created for us??  Ok I'm goning to go take a little breath of fresh air and rest for a moment as this is very disturbing to me! .... V.O.R. and I agree on something. I think I'm going to be sick!! Back in a few.
775	1	a	"Simone, read the sentence again please. It was ""Saving lives is ""not just"" a Republican goal."" It concerns the subject of abortion.   The only way it relates to the politics of Iraq, is that abortionist would rather kill our kids before they get to ""volunteer"" their services for Iraq.   I can't let one statement you made go though. Terrorist continue to terrorize us? Where have they attacked in the U.S. since 9-11? Consider continuing this in an appropriate thread."
776	1	a	Thankyou for bringing to my attention that atoms, neutrons and protons are merely scientific assumptions. Now as I gaze at the night sky with all its' bits and pieces spinning around each other I can sleep happily knowing that our solar system is not part of a housebrick afterall.
777	1	a	What makes you think I don't. Yours is not the only religion on earth!! And I didn't just jump to the concluision that your soul needed concern, so don't jump to it with me.
778	1	a	It was a troll. Now that we've activated email response, it could take another look or expand some mail list.
779	1	a	As usual, you shoot from the lip. I have no illusion of perfection, However I am convinced that as long as you live I will never be the dumbest man on earth.
780	1	a	And yet the post-Dunblane handgun ban happened after only one event.
781	1	a	Like evolution, right? You have your conclusion, so everything else must adhere to it. Just answer the question. How to you account for the statements above?
782	1	a	Just helping something live doesn't affect evolution unless it affects the ability to reproduce viable offspring.   If there was no nylon before the 1940s and there is an organism that can survive by eating NOTHING else, what does that tell you? There could not have been a population of nylon-eating bacteria before 1940. This is a new population that did not exist before.
783	1	a	Nah, he has been TRAINED to recognize demonic possession as part of his B.A.
784	1	a	I think jyoshu has posted a BS meter which is pretty nice.
785	1	a	What's your point? Unicorns breathe toxic gas and have low density, so they can get around all they want.
786	1	a	I want to know how giving her abusers more reason to abuse her makes sense too.
787	1	a	Don't forget cheaper to feed, take orders better, and are harder to hit.
788	1	a	Wow, so Balrogs existed according to the Bible? Whoda thunk.
789	1	a	Oh yes, Mr Behe makes a comfortable living out of selling to the ignorant. His newest book is just a rehash of his old book, and has the very same flaws that have been destroyed over and over again. As for your 'religious authors' being respected.. they are respected perhaps by the fundamentalists that do not understand what science is about.
790	1	a	"You bet. Got a Scriptural problem with that, 'O ""jesus""? Or are you not familiar with your own inspired Word?"
791	1	a	I guess the Sinagua ruins and the Kayenta, Anasazi Wukoki ruins in Arizona just don't stack up against them big old Jewish buildings.
792	1	a	Oh it applies, but if we were to look at the Bible that way, God wouldn't allow one single bad thing to happen.
793	1	a	That's an out that's peculiar to Christians. Good? Godidit. Bad? Devil's work.
794	1	a	Oh, dear. I seem to have lost you again. 'Peer' just means a group of people holding the same biases.
795	1	a	because you wanna be wrong all the time...that seems like a good reason :)
796	1	a	"Because of massive cultural differences. You might as well be asking ""if both Americans and British people speak basic english, why do British people refer to apartments as flats?"""
797	1	a	Possibly, I must admit I never tried to gain access to swords whilst over there.
798	1	a	Isn't that exactly what I said! Clearly we have an issue of a probably overweight white man who is without a doubt racist (because if we know anything it is that every white male that has short hair is a racist) coming down on a black woman!   You nailed it again MA! Props to you for uncovering this mystery.
799	1	a	I know I know. Unless a woman is gestating or dieing she is being selfish.
800	1	a	"Then by that standard, christianity is horse puckey! Christians contradict each other. Oh! But wait. Anyone who disagrees with you isn't ""really"" a christian."
801	1	a	Gee, I wonder why the liberal left is so quiet? I remember when Bush's DWI from decades previously came out, and you couldn't shut the hypocrites up!   It's hilarious.
802	1	a	Or, since he didn't have $37-million tucked away from questionable business practices and a rich daddy, perhaps he paid attention to the ramifications of abnormal deficit spending.
803	1	a	Uncle Sam hasn't tried to pass a law saying people can't install left-handed doornobs, to supposedly protect the doornobs of right-handed people. I guess right-handed people don't feel threatened by the minority. What a concept!
804	1	a	Anyone speaking English could well be an illegal from the UK then, right?   I guess Puerto Ricans better watch out too.
805	1	a	Are you really so dim that you think me answering a question you POSTED is somehow any implication at all on thelmoose's intelligence? emoticonXRolleyes
806	1	a	Na. Probably from smokin the Bovine Excrement they are trying to pedal! emoticonXSmilie
807	1	a	"lol...you read my whole post only to conclude with ""what's your point."" Evolutionist brilliance on display. I'm not mistaking nothing for nothing. I know my stuff. You obviously know nothing and don't care to learn it."
808	1	a	Have you lost your mind? I got no idea what you are talking about.
809	1	a	"Your signal to noise ratio was too low for my tastes: too much ""wackiness"" (I assume ""wackiness"" was what you were trying for) and irrelevant side discussions."
810	1	a	Have some cheese with your whine, turkey?  Who is the liar? It is the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a person is an antichrist. 1 John 2:22  That would be you and those like you. Repent, you heathen!
811	1	a	Let's establish a campaign to search for the hypocrisy of people who call themselves pro-life yet find nothing wrong with killing a grown human being.
812	1	a	Why am I not surprised chester, that chloe directly giving an in depth answer to you is perceived as not being germane to the topic. Since you never directly answer any proposition forwarded as you derail every thread by just serving up your off topic tripe. emoticonXGood
813	1	a	I wasn't aware that a hairstyle could choose to believe (or not believe) in a god.............
814	1	a	Look at Dunblane. Then look at Columbine. Who had the higher death toll?  How often do school shootings take place in Germany?  When was the last time somebody went driving and shooting in a killing spree in America?  Name the last mass public killing in America, in a public place where the number of victims reached double digit territory.  Go on Brady, we're waiting for you to prove that you actually have a point. Don't disappoint us.
815	1	a	"And the Brady background check has not been repealed either so by your ""logic"" it must be effective."
816	1	a	Leave it to a leftist to cite a leftist forum for evidence that a leftist agenda is supported by dedicated leftists. Go figure, huh? This post just proves that attempting to reason with such an irrational thinker is truly a waste of time and effort.
817	1	a	It appears that peddler is finally open to learning new things! (Unless, of course, peddler is simply being facetious... which is not obvious from the immediate context.)
818	1	a	Do you know how many Osama Bin Ladens we Killed???? emoticonXRolleyes
819	1	a	<flush>  Just come up with something that discredits the resurrection, if you think you can. Should be easy for you Einsteins, shouldn't it?  But in two years I haven't seen it yet. Not from you or anybody else.  Where's the beef?
820	1	a	Sounds like he/she has a problem with abstinence within the RCC and you have a thin skin about it.
821	1	a	Congratulations, Hunter. You have just accepted the 5 primary tenets of fundamentalism. So I guess that makes you a fundamentalist.
822	1	a	Sweetie, if every gay person were as wealthy as Mary Cheney, we could laugh all the way to the bank and ignore the prejudice in society the way she does. Indeed, we'd probably be the darlings of the GOP. Unfortunately for your delusion, gays are no more or less wealthy on average than anyone else.
823	1	a	That post is not only off topic, but yet a further example of your being completely out of touch with reality.
824	1	a	I think you need to breathe in a bag for a while..then maybe have a nap.
825	1	a	Please do, because according to your source McVeigh called himself an Agnostic.
826	1	a	You're equating atheism and homosexuality with terrorism and drug dealing? Really? Can you stop being a reactionary dolt long enough to convince me you're worth even trying to converse with? If not, I'll understand... and not be surprised.
827	1	a	Cower in fear of your god Easy, I'm not afraid, and nothing that you say is going to make me fear things which I believe to be imaginary.   Thankfully, our nation does not make laws based on your Phelpsian beliefs that god punishes the masses for the sins of others.
828	1	a	Sorry baby the story was in the religion of peace land. Your strawman is burning.
829	1	a	Is that right next to ANWR? Are the Canadians downplaying ANWR while they side drill to extract our precious fluids? emoticonXClown
830	1	a	A truly charming publication. Over flowing with the warmth of human goodness.
831	1	a	You also need to borrow a new insult. Did you get that one from Crim?
832	1	a	So? What does that prove? That Cheney's draft number was called more often than Slick's? emoticonXConfused
833	1	a	Senior citizen yachties stand little chance of defending themselves against pirates.   Piracy needs to be dealt with using military might.
834	1	a	Someone once said that the poor would always be with us.   I'll keep in mind that your core beliefs include the notion that what the poor really need is a hard day's work. You're a prophet I tell ya!
835	1	a	Oops, my bad. You're right of course. Port is an interface on a computer. It's also a harbour, so you're wrong too! :P
836	1	a	I guess I'd rather live among them, too, than have a hot poker shoved up my bottom.
837	1	a	Did you notice how what I was responding to was said? I didn't think so. Your tunnel vision is showing again.
838	1	a	You mus think you're pretty smart huh? Well guess what? You're confusing common, most common, majority, and norm. Lefthandedness is considerd common and the norm. You're using a superstistion from 300 years ago to qualify left handedness as deviant. Good try though.  Also left handed is genetic. It's not a gene but it's genetically related to the person's physical characteristics.
839	1	a	"No. What the doctor was doing was going to church. He was not a monster. He was not a ""sicko."" He was a murder victim.   What his murderer did was murder."
840	1	a	Yes, we shouldn't let those slaves be citizens, they will burden our legal system since they will now have...OMG...rights!
841	1	a	Ha, that is just an idiotic perspective. We'd have no laws (and many important ones) if you can't make a bill that doesn't affect you. Sorry Civil Rights legislation!
842	1	a	Well then, you would immediately notice a 15% reduction in bullying! Rejoice!
843	1	a	That does not surprise me. A whole world filled with people who look, speak, think, and do things different than you must be absolutely terrifying.
844	1	a	Yep, you libs would love that. Then you could party on end without having your carnal consciences tweaked, LOL! No sin then no need for a Savior.
845	1	a	"Yep, Martha is in trouble and the democrats are panicking.   I think the strong Independent support for her opponent is due to Martha's own lack of appeal.   By they way, I have to ask....since ""The anointed one"" was in your neck of the woods, did you get a peek at him? prehaps even wave at him (with all 4 fingers) ;)"
846	1	a	Which you would do by having teachers teach kids that being gay is alright. You would teach those kids, against their parents wishes, that being gay is alright. You would do that after you make it legal WITHOUT A POPULAR VOTE. Seems that you really don't give a rat's XXX about this poor dead kid at all. You just see his corpse and throw him on top of your gay marriage banner. How noble of you.
847	1	a	So I take it you don't accept my challenge on the basis that it is impossible? Why is it impossible? Or better yet, why don't we al just evolve into perfect, anti-sinning creatures with 500 IQ points a piece?
848	1	a	I believe that the theory you speak of is called slavery; everybody is equal because they have nothing and need to work long and hard just to earn the privilege of living in order to serve their masters.
849	1	a	Ok, so you utterly missed the whole religion vs. faith part of the discussion, got it.
850	1	a	Well, then, I guess that in America we can't possibly be safe from kill-happy gunners can we?
851	1	a	Oh, well, then that settles the argument doesn't it. It must be a person because she says so, now. Maybe she will change her mind again?
852	1	a	Wow ehat a brave new world you live in.... Now lets say just 1% of all gun owners resisted (in the us that is several hundred thousand peppered through the land). With media attention to such infighting between government and citizens how do you deal with this?
853	1	a	Here's some advice, if you're going to try and crack on me, make your 'jokes' (I'll be nice and call them that) less passive and more active, grammar-wise.   Crim-   A definition is the meaning of word that someone created using their own opinions. Is there a difference?   And, a circle could be called a circle in the English language, but I could make up a new language in which a circle would be called a square and a square a circle.
854	1	a	So you advocate religion not because it is the truth, but instead because it gives you comfort and security? The opiate of the masses eh?
855	1	a	First off, kudos on getting the quotes right! It's much appreciated.  Now, what's your actual assertion? If you spell it out than we can put this definition debate in context, and maybe actually get somewhere.
856	1	a	ER, you're doing the God complex again. Sandra Fluke might not even use birth control because she may very well be celibate. Only God ... and ER who thinks he's God ... know.
857	1	a	I just bet you thought you were smart just now? I'll go you several...   How about:  1. Murder  2. Stealing  3. Adultery  4. Rape  Almost every culture since the dawn of civilization has put to death those who have trespassed those basics. But I guess you didn't get that on the Recovery Channel huh? Your idiocy is profound only as your ignorance.
858	1	a	Did your mummy read you scary stories when you were littler?
859	1	a	Oh, gee! There goes my irony meter. It pegged and started smoking at the end of the first sentence. Archy is just being christian by trying to impose his twisted morality on everyone.
860	1	a	Before you were claiming it was a slippery slope. Now you're claiming it's a strawman. Perhaps you don't understand what either term means.
861	1	a	But rather than be honest about your mistake, you just changed things without paying any attention to the fact that we've shown you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to the claims of the scientific community.. at least, not until somebody tells you. (And you accuse me of not having a teacher's mentality as I educate you in something you didn't previously know... How pathetic.)
862	1	a	Tell me genius, how is me accurately and correctly pointing out your mistake colluding to misdirect anyone? Either you are again using words you don't know the meaning of to make such an inaccurate statement, or you're just lying. So which is it penfold, are you ignorant or just being dishonest again? emoticonXConfused
863	1	a	Talk about a crock! How can you wail on anyone with your imaginary truth stick of no mercy when you wouldn't know the truth if you tripped over it? And you going ballistic like this just proves the exact point I made in that you'll allow my free speech until I say something you disagree with and then you attack me to shut me up. Which is exactly what I said above that precipitated your childish tirade. See?
864	1	a	Michael Moore Hates America is also coming out in theaters some time in October.
865	1	a	"Hey, maybe some chosen by God religious fundamentalist will offer up his own daughters to be gang-raped, and then later have sex with those same daughters and children by them. You know, the way Lot did in the Bible. The one Peter called ""a righteous man""."
866	1	a	My point stands, just because you can't get it has no impact at all on its validity. YouTube - The jokes on you...
867	1	a	"Tell me, how does one ""steal land"" from a nomad? emoticonXConfused"
868	1	a	You forgot to mention that we would have to change our numbering system so that grasshoppers had 4 legs.
869	1	a	Ok, EF, so am i likely to win the lottery before i meet an alian?
870	1	a	Like I said, Catholic school. Or it could be that you're like 80 years old or something, because nowadays, if you talk about God or the Bible, then you don't get in trouble, you get criticized and made-fun-of, not only by your peers, but also by teachers.
871	1	a	I noticed that you do reply to mine. Perhaps you should reconsider since you're getting your ar$e handed to you with every reply I write. ;)
872	1	a	So, once again, the lack of criminal prosecution isn't due to the red herring that you claim, but rather the incompetence of the Justice Department. Franken's bill doesn't have a provision for making the Justice Department do its job, does it?
873	1	a	I don't really give a flying hippo's arse what you think - your posts here and on the other forums are repugnant, and as of now, you are being put on ignore (to take a page from Steeeeve).
874	1	a	"Not only is Phyllis right in calling you what you are but you clearly ignore reality. You were already called on using incorrect facts once...you might as well say ""denying abortion will cause 10000000 bagillion deaths a day"""
875	1	a	"I'm against polygamy, marriages with underaged minors and marriages to livestock as well, so don't feel that you are the only ones not ""accomodated""."
876	1	a	<Flush>  Your own source said there's a cliff a mile and a half away, and I'm the liar? Go find it and jump off it, you flaming, incompetent, scatter-brained, dishonest cretin.
877	1	a	An objective test? Wow! Tell me, how do you prove this test is a true useful test? Please don't tell me reason or yet another objective test.
878	1	a	Strange, I thought it was supposed to be a global flood that wiped out all of man except the chosen few. That would be 'involving Australia' one assumes.
879	1	a	So it doesn't matter that someone dies in their forties from hunger and cold because they are homeless and penniless, whilst another lives in luxury with the best food and medicines until his 80s: they are both equal? What planet do you live on, for it sure aren't the real world...
880	1	a	You mean that the planets and stars have always existed? Really - so how come we see stars being made in nurseries via the Hubble telescope.
881	1	a	And I'm guessing by your misinformed posts that you have not been high before. Did you recently watch a film called Reefer Madness by any chance?
882	1	a	Is this satire? If so...bravo...well done. emoticonXGood If you are really serious...ummmm...excuse me. emoticonXEmbarrassed
883	1	a	"Not to speak for Jim, but I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess it was ""Rebuttlickan"". Just a hunch."
884	1	a	On the bright side, it appears that the Rapture will solve the Social Security financing problem...
885	1	a	So somebody try and tell us, that with stuff like this going on, that America still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of Mexico.
886	1	a	Ah, so I don't like democracy, and yet it is you who in the post are telling me that I have to support McCain's statement. Are you serious? That sure doesn't sound like democracy to me. I also find it funny that you claim that I don't like democracy when my very post stated that I would be voting for the Democrat party. But then, I guess if we don't support Bushyboy and his fellow republicanazis, we must be against democracy, right? Get real, Phyllis.
887	1	a	Not in the mood? Oh I see because they restrict you already your not in the mood to remove the regulations that do not work and insert proper ones that do. Excellent ignore the issue at hand and give no suggestion to improve upon the current laws and restrictions....
888	1	a	Really??? Maybe you should do a little research before you make sweeping statements like that. -- http://www.rainbowbaptists.org/
889	1	a	"Once one is adept at finding evidence after a conclusion is presumed, all sorts of ""proofs"" reveal themselves. What's next, Nostradamus?"
890	1	a	In my lifetime, we've made huge strides, but there's a lot more to learn.
891	1	a	And why would you say something like this? Because Christianity prohibits it? I can't think of any other reason.
892	1	a	It's a real mess, though you've to got to give them points for originality.
893	1	a	60% accepting Roe v Wade is a high figure don't you think? More people support abortion then the president.
894	1	a	Do you need faith to know the sun will rise tomorrow or that 2 + 2 = 4 or to know that if you drop a rock it will fall to the ground?
895	1	a	I'm not big on the abortion issue, but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is sexist and arrogant? That's a tactic straight from the leftist playbook. Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents. Isn't it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them? Now that's irony!
896	1	a	I'm sure it is many a doctors' spiritual duty to relieve suffering, just as Jesus healed the sick.   Besides, who wants to go back to 40 year average lifespan, like they have in Afghanistan? Not me.
897	1	a	"If the rejecting of the ""lifestyle"" results in death, beatings, job displacement, eviction, insults or inequality, then what would YOU call it? ""Religious moral code?"""
898	1	a	"Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, ""....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically."" you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence."
899	1	a	Ah, so we shouldn't get all stirred up because little girls are singled out for slaughter?  Please excuse me for having misplaced priorities.
900	1	a	Sorry did I say pacifist?I meant yellow bellied pacifist.However if its any consolation, I meant anti's in general not just you Sinj.sorry if it sounded that way.
901	1	a	So, some parts of the Bible are erroneous oral history after all! What a refreshing admission.
902	1	a	Are you serious? Man I thought you actually had a brain in that dense hollow cranium of yours. You do realize there are Straight Atheists and GAY Christians right Gans?
903	1	a	You can start your own thread on how historical the Gospel accounts, etc., are.   How about dealing with the question now instead of running scared and going down another rabbit trail?
904	1	a	If it did that, then you might have won an argument by now.
905	1	a	The point being that nobody is spoiling Christmas for the children, you paranoid fruit cake.
906	1	a	While I fully realize you can't do math and thus why you consider it atheism, but post #96 and post #81 are not the same post. But then again, you were the one who argued that post 113 came before 106 so maybe you do think that complete failure to understand math and linear thinking is sane?
907	1	a	"Demolishing your ""rebuttal"" in post #14 does, however. You missed it."
908	1	a	Maybe because it's a loaded question? If another evolution hoax were discovered similar to Piltdown man, would you reject evolution and become a Christian? :p
909	1	a	You are the only one in this discussion that shows a predominant lack of logic or reason. Your position has been proven wrong, get over it .
910	1	a	What about them? Is this a question?   Um. Have you read Leveticus? And I mean, read it. Not skimmed it.   Because, God loves everybody. Are you reaching?   And what does fast and loose mean? I'm confused. I think you are trying to label me.. but I'm not quite sure what I'm being labled as.   What part about people burning in hell for eternity?
911	1	a	Symbiote seems to have had a large hair across his butt.
912	1	a	"Because of your question "" What is your definition of pure"", I now know how to make soap. I'll never stink again!!! And I think homeopathic medicine is all about using things like vitamin c to prevent colds, and making sure you ingest lots of calcium if you are worried about ostioperosis. Ya know stuff that makes sense."
913	1	a	Is it possible to be an adult and be as clueless as you seem to be?  This was in response to the question did Jesus not believe in evolution.  Only someone with similar mental capacity to yours would ask such a question.  It seems unfair I have to answer this senseless comment you added to the nonsense.
914	1	a	We are figments of our own imaginations, sent here by Satan to annoy the faithful! emoticonXAngel
915	1	a	Well, in the case of a creationist, the bias determines what evidence will be discarded, what evidence will be twisted, what evidence will simply be ignored.
916	1	a	"ah yes.....""Gaytheist,"" the terminal homosexual atheist liar at various forums such as IIDB and Tweb misrepresents me to some guy who studies tadpoles. The little XXXX liar atheist claimed to the author that I used his paper as ""evidence"" of lamarckism -- which was a bold-face lie that she couldn't back up when I pressed her on it. This was merely his response to her strawman lie. Funny how you must repeat these lies to help cover up how pathetic your theory is."
917	1	a	"What's your evidence that the Gospel prophecies are ""spurious claims""? Seems like you've bought into a scalding case of rational tunnel-vision (or political correctness, if you prefer)."
918	1	a	That explains your excellent use of grammar, word choice and spelling? ROTFLMAO
919	1	a	Aw shucks! And I reckon in Kansas they won't ever care whether or not you learn how to spell ATHEIST.
920	1	a	BOY-HOWDY!! Why don't you let me know how you really feel? I have not tried to demonize anything. Rap music does that to itself without any help from me. Rap is the lowest form of music that I have ever heard. It is just too primative for my tastes. Once again, I am not a racist, nor am I sexist. I do my own washing. I wish you and your child nothing but the best in life. Some folks think that exposing young children to Rap music is a form of child abuse, I agree with those folks.  P.S. Tell that Southern girl to find another room-mate, you sound like a horrible role model. Well, got to go wash some more underwear.
921	1	a	That's because the Taliban in Afghanistan didn't have any oil with which to bribe them.
922	1	a	:p I wish! If I did, I'd be as wealthy as the Church, who does. emoticonXHoho
923	1	a	Make up your mind. Is it because of diet or is it because of evolution. It would be nice if you pick a horse and ride it.
924	1	a	I'm now slightly less confused about why I've never seen this discussed before.
925	1	a	"Never thought of that. If that ""person"" has rights, do they have responsibilities? Could a fetus be charged for causing toxemia? How about suing the little tyke for giving mom varicose veins and stretch marks?"
926	1	a	Yea right you are likely to know. Stick with the enema hotline.
927	1	a	So, you're just an anti-geologist, anti-cosmologist, anti-archaeologist, anti-physicist, and probably a few more that I can't be arsed to think of right now. *shrugs* Might as well get it over with and just say you're an anti-science religious nutter.
928	1	a	Just like it's the job of the gun control lobby to try and pass an overwhelming, unreasonable level of fear of an inanimate object?
929	1	a	Talk about incoherent wishful thinking. Instead of unsubstantiated claims and baseless attacks, why don't you provide, oh, I don't know, mybe some peer-reviewed EVIDENCE? You know, that little old thing that is required for anyone to take your wild claims even remotely seriously?
930	1	a	I like the Grape Flavored best, But I won't be drinking any KoolAid with you or one of your religious Cult Fanatics...   And why would I be embarrassed about telling the truth?....
931	1	a	"Well, if history were binding we would still have slavery...and abortions being illegal for that matter. Something being done for a long time doesn't mean it makes it in the constitution. I don't know which part of the constitution has a ""preserve history"" clause."
932	1	a	Oh yeah right, like sociopaths who are bent on killing and slaughtering everyone around them, can be fixed with something as stupid as school counseling.
933	1	a	I guess it is a bad thing to make his wife cry but the republicans can make any hatefilled statement of attack against gay and lesbian americans and that is ok.
934	1	a	Why don't you answer Bryan's post above troll? He has some important information you would never figure out by yourself?
935	1	a	"What! You mean that WE don't want to do all of those things? Who knew? I didn't get the memo? emoticonXConfused   And you forgot ""make Seniors eat dog food"". emoticonXGood"

937	1	a	So what are you claiming now? That all this time that Rosie was making fun of the Chinese, she's actually been Chinese all the while? Because that's the only legitimate way you could draw a parallel with those people who are hypocritically attacking gays while being gay themselves.
938	1	a	Well, if you combined his plan with all the others, then make all the cuts at once, you would be like 25% of the way there!!   Come on, Steeeve...we have limited material to work with here.....

Um, for the record I grew up on the prairie and saw a goodly bit of ""wind-driven snow"" and it was not particularly pure. A feeble and laughable metaphor."

949	1	a	You mean like Korea? Oh wait we are still there....  Is Israel a nice secure place safe from terrorism? The notion that Iraq will be without conflict will not occur in our life time.
950	1	a	Confucius, that is one of the biggest puddles of sentimental puppy dribble that has ever been manufactured.

953	1	a	"I think pedophilia is a disorder as opposed to an illness but I'd have to look back at some psychology books. How do I define illness? Well, I have a few contexts for this. The flu...obvious illness. Christians feel that sin is an ""illness"", so in that sense we are all rather ill :). As for wrong...same deal."
954	1	a	"Now you're just being an butt. The word Dungarees is a coloquialism. Do you know what that word means?   Also that's what jeans were called before the word ""jeans' entered the venacular. (Do you know what that word means?)   So, now are you going to tell me that only homosexuals have larger vocabularies?   Get a life...and preferably not mine...I'm living it at the moment."
955	1	a	Odd. I can't seem to find any racial slurs or racist ideology in those sentences. In fact, I don't see any race or races in general even mentioned. You're just one of those people who thinks you can win a discussion by accusing your opponents of being racist. Sorry simone, but in the real world, people can disagree with your leftist views (which are barely existent) without being racist.
956	1	a	And oddly enough you have been given several on silver platters. Perhaps you need to visit a neurologist and get checked for memory problems? Just to remind you once more - SICKLE CELL TRAIT is a mutation AND it benefits the phenotype under specific definable conditions. Do you really want to get hit about the head with that bat yet again?
957	1	a	You mean the truth of thousands of young teen girls dead with a coat hanger in hand? Abortion is a neccessity so that it can be regulated. People will have abortions legal or not legal. At least provide a safety net other than a coat hanger.
958	1	a	So if Jitobear's mother had the option to abort Jitobear in utero, you want Jitobear to have the same option with any children she carries? That's awfully progressive of you.
959	1	a	I think it would be best for neither one to have a gun, as there would be no chance of me getting hurt. After all, I could beat up a guy armed with a plastic fork. However, if the hijacker has a gun, I'd like someone (not me, I'm half blind in each eye, I'd probably hit a passanger or something) to have a gun.
960	1	a	So what do ya Say! Come On. Be reasonable! Do it for the children! Or don't we care about these children because they weren't hurt or killed by a firearm?
961	1	a	Makes about as much sense as saying many of the car hating crowd (people who support such laws as car registration) also own cars. More evidence that your handlers have trained you to see the world in black and white.
962	1	a	Is North Korea a bastion of peace and good-living? Nope. Is it religious? Nope. Therefore obstacles to 'peace' don't necessarily have to be tied in with religiosity.  Hope that's spelt out enough for you. Try to keep up.

964	1	a	Perhaps some people here aren't on the same level of intelligence. Seems you and chester understand it now so that is good.
965	1	a	Yup, I get the drift. You're the sort that is in denial about how he feels about gays; equating tolerance for gays with tolerance for murderers, while pretending you're doing something else. Now I know how you think, thanks!
966	1	a	Worship me and I'll bless you too. With money of course. He can't even give you money. I am the true god and I created the mindset that he was a god in him. Worship me and spread the word about the true religion. Everyone who joins my church will instantly get $1,000 and after a week of membership you will get $1 million. The end of the week is when my project is and then you can go into the real world. All those who didn't believe in me will be destroyed when my world I created gets to the dump.
967	1	a	Hmmm, was that an ad hominem attack? You know, what you accuse others of doing? Hypocrite.
968	1	a	OMG, are you for real? I'd think that if you saw a plane flying low, being chased by a fighter jet, you'd get out of the way. Any SANE person would...  Further, you'd be peeved if you found out that it was your govt. being completely insensitive (not to mention wasteful). The govt. screwed up...if it had been Bush you'd be crying bloody murder.
969	1	a	You of course have documentation of Darwin laying out his plan as to how to weasel evolution into classrooms to oust theism, right? No? You're making it all up? Shocking.
970	1	a	Well, considering how ambiguous and contradictory the Christian scriptures are, I guess this interpetation makes as much sense as any of the others.

I suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake. You wouldn't want the perp to be disadvantaged too much now would you? How many shots must one allow the perp before you can fire back?
985	1	a	Dude, my own father had hospice care in my home up until he died. I think I know a thing or two about it. None of what you say disproves that end-of-life can still be a scary thing. Maybe if you'd stop just being belligerent about it and actually thoughtfully discuss it, you might actually find some things I'm saying you find agreeable. (GASP!)
986	1	a	Absolutely, and I am suggesting we first attack Sweden. That's my plan. emoticonXBanghead emoticonXBanghead

993	1	a	Non-aggressive, yeah. That's why it's Israel that's the occupying force in Palestine and not the other way around. emoticonXWow
994	1	a	Absolutely. Because atheists are spiritually constipated and are too dumb to realize God and Christ are real.

As for what to do with him then, show me under the New Covenant where Jesus said to stone kids?  Personally, I think we should stone obese, jaded statues of weird looking holy men.
997	1	a	Eighty-nine times. Still quite a junior partner. I must admit that he doesn't like to be slighted though, as evidenced by Luke 12:10. One can say some nasty things about the Son of Man, and all's fine. But say one off-colored comment about the Holy Ghost and it's lakes-o-fire time. He needs to get thicker skin, IMO. Do ghosts have skin, BTW?
998	1	a	Do you have to have human organs to be considered a person? Who made this rule??? You? What if you get lung removed...are you less of a person? So around 8 weeks though you believe it is in fact a human?

So for purposes of this discussion I crown you the ""insult king"" of this forum."
1001	1	a	"He stated that "" statistics show that firearms cause aggression in individuals"", no mention of the word can anywhere in there that I saw."
1002	1	a	That is exactly what he is here for. To spread god's.. 'love'.
1003	1	a	that was a cheap shot my friend.. lets keep at around an a*d*u*l*t level.. shall we?
1004	1	a	"What is this ""we"" stuff? Got a mouse in your pocket? I thought god was going to destroy it...not ""we""."
1005	1	a	Quite true. Top that with the adolescent mentality exhibited by SP and the boys and you've got yourself a reason to consider calling Dr. Jack Kevorkian.
1006	1	a	So most of your friends have had sex with your guy too? emoticonXGood  You and I both know that homosexuals have different partners regularly, at least compared to heterosexuals.
1007	1	a	I take it that you are not educated about maternal mortality in pregnancy, then?
1008	1	a	Say hello to my little friend! We the people, through our State Governments!
1009	1	a	Sure you don't want to address the gaping holes in your argument. That's up to you.
1010	1	a	In the thousands of scientific papers that present the thousands of bits of evidence that go to prove evolution beyond all sensible sane and reasonable doubt.
1011	1	a	But what makes them any different from ant hills or beaver dams? skyscrapers are natural because humans are a part of nature and they built them.
1012	1	a	I must say, you are quite a creepy addict. You seem pretty dangerous when high, especially since you think everything is a good idea. And why would you want his soul? emoticonXConfused Are you in a cult? Is that why you get high? I can see why teachers would need to go to attitude school after meeting you. They might need some help, as well as do you. And as contrary to your side subject, I think I am quite different than you.
1013	1	a	Can cause aggression, does not mean that it will though. Alcohol has a far greater record of this but yall are not trying to ban that. So do women but we arent going to ban them now are we, Sorry but I was in a marriage from hell and just had to throw that in.
1014	1	a	Nice attempt at an audition. Since the law firm you hired is supposed to find a director and president for your crumbled .org do you think you will get the job? What's the matter, didn't Hennigan cut it after the other lawyer fled when he saw the handwriting on the wall? emoticonXGood
1015	1	a	I am actually getting my entertainment value out of WW and his lack of knowledge, along with his attempts to ########. If you or the others are bothered by his ignorant banter please let me know, and I will stop forcing him to give answers on subjects that he so obviously has no clue.
1016	1	a	Well uh I am a fan. & you remind me of Humpty Dumpty.
1017	1	a	As I have pointed out, the only BS here is your accusations.
1018	1	a	When I think of the great minds of literature, Ann Coulter is certainly not on the top of my list. In fact, when I think of minds, I don't even think she has one. I hope that you write this in jest, otherwise...I would seriously suggest that you expand you horizons. emoticonXFrazzled
1019	1	a	WOW are we seeing the softer, gentiler Jyoshu?   Your snoopy avatar must be afecting you :) :p
1020	1	a	BOY-HOWDY!!!!! You have spoken the truth and spoken it well. Welcome to you from the conservative South.
1021	1	a	So according to you, you'd prefer it if only the bad guys are armed, because that makes it easy to tell who's the bad guy and who's the good guy; being the good guy is never armed, and thus never able to defend themselves.
1022	1	a	And, I'm sure you ask yourself that very question before you unzip your fly and whip out your pecker, right?
1023	1	a	Ok if we can not use guns. Can we use baseball bats? Is that OK with you?
1024	1	a	And the UN seems to feel it's necessary to spell out that you have the right to marry and have a family.
1025	1	a	And would guns in the hands of citizens have stopped that? Or does publicity, which has only increased since those events, stop them? Your selective reading ability is at work.
1026	1	a	Nonsense. Just look at all the great things that the Dark Ages did for Europe!
1027	1	a	Yeah, cause there are sooo many 100 year old corks just kickin around.
1028	1	a	I think he is just disturbed because he didn't get his 40 acres and mule?
1029	1	a	Someone's help? Whoever are you talking about? It wasn't any much work at all. A simple search. I'm pointing it out to you in the hopes that you'll get some new material. That and the fact I'd rather not see you banned.
1030	1	a	I guess you never thought that many Cathoilics have gays in their family, or should they ask them to take their lives ?
1031	1	a	You'll never have that problem comic relief. You'll always be young mentally.
1032	1	a	Where do you get off saying that kind of tripe to somebody?  That kind of insane comment is typical of far left loons like you who lie for a living and don't have the common sense of a fence post.  And that goes for Jo Bennett too if he's agreeing with you.  Cretins.
1033	1	a	Oh, EZ, so this god of yours wants to see ME, does he?  Well and good. Because when I have access to that god he is going to get an earful from me about how his people have screwed over the world.
1034	1	a	This will kill innovation. do you know how many years a start up business might be in the red before it generates a profit? Why bother when you know you are going to be clubbed as soon as you realize a profit? Yep, way to incentivize business there...
1035	1	a	No, the law didn't specifically mention gays, or dwarfs, or one-eyed pirates, or 6 toed individuals. emoticonXRolleyes
1036	1	a	Archie, the only way you can possibly come to that conclusion is by literally ignoring everything the author says, every accepted definition of the words socialism, statism, capitalism, fascism and nazism. If we ignore everything the author says and make up our own definitions for those words, it STILL does not work because the argument is STILL illogical and you look like a dishonest fool making it.   Face it. You got pwned. Are you really not bright enough to recognize that?
1037	1	a	"Did you actually read it? I suspect not. Did you think that I wouldn't? I suspect so. Did you think that no one here would have any knowledge of good old ""Kimisaurus"" (that's what it was tagged when Kim was telling us about it)? I suspect so."
1038	1	a	Dragons and Dinosaurs coexisting only recently? hmm when they did dissapear? Maybe Conan the Barbarian killed them all!
1039	1	a	No EasyRidden.. It's you right wing fundies who have attempted for years to rewrite history to fit your religion into our constitution. America is a nation which has always had a population of christians, but it was never a Christian nation. The Words God, Jebus, Holy Spirit.. are NOT included in any of the founding documents. You can continue to ignore the history, you're the one looking like a buffoon.
1040	1	a	But being American, she knew killing Iraqi children would be the right thing to do FOR TOTAL VICTORY FOR AMERIKA!!1!!
1041	1	a	i assume you can demonstrate that everyone that opposes or critiques gay rights are personally attacking an individual or group? please, be my guest
1042	1	a	I've got a better compromise. We'll keep our magazines in whatever size we please, and we'll ban you, J Miro, Simone, and a random forum troll to be named later. That sounds fair and even in terms of trade to me.
1043	1	a	I guess it's a good thing I wasn't replying and/or talking to you then. But thanks for your input, it has been noted.
1044	1	a	Reasonable gun regulation is an oxymoron like military intelligence. You mean like Bill Ayers (sic) and his wife or Carl Rowen? Wait my bad they aren't from the right.
1045	1	a	Well it came from somewhere and presumably changed as it went along.   Careful there that ones been clearly shown to be the case - in a laboratory environment to boot. Not to mention in the form of a hydrogen bomb!   You mean that the planets and stars have always existed? Really - so how come we see stars being made in nurseries via the Hubble telescope.   So you don't believe that life had an origin! WOW so you think its always been present on the Earth? Not even the bible goes that far! And you fail to account for the observation that there IS life.   Thats not an evolutionary theory, at least not a scientific one. Kinds is a theological construct not a biological one and MOST creationists use the KINDS thing as a support for their arguments.
1046	1	a	ROFL....Yeah, right, since you 'left wingers' seriously see yourself as center-right.....whaddayah know?
1047	1	a	And you're baffled that you don't have more intelligent debate with people. I'm shocked.
1048	1	a	Math is confusing too, doesn't mean we should get rid of it.
1049	1	a	"It has been 33 years. The allies managed to stop the holocaust in only two. You guys are certainly dragging your feet at stopping the great American ""holocaust"" against ""unborn babies."""
1050	1	a	It truly is sad when an opponent is friendlier than an ally, Mega. At least Ian responded in a friendly way, and me and him don't even agree on this issue.
1051	1	a	Archie, you're not one of those Westboro Baptist Chuch types, are you? You don't buy that stuff about 'God Hates the ### Army' and 'God hates America' do you?
1052	1	a	Oh thats not politically kerect and secially wif the chosen one doing the world apology toure I don't see that going down.   Well lay a few on us sin baby. Give us the deal.
1053	1	a	"I guess they could if they knew where all the parts were located. Oh, I would think they would be in hell. I can't imagine ""God"" would have anything to do with mass murderers; do you?   BTW, this is Osama's technical guide for the terrorists.   http://www.almostaproverb.com/images4/osama_dummies.jpg"
1054	1	a	So let's just kill them and be done with it. Is that what you're saying?
1055	1	a	"And what does he mean by that? You apparently don't have a clue. Tell me, do you have any idea what ""secondary cause"" is?"
1056	1	a	Aw declare victory and slither off eh. I made an assertof fact that was backed up. You made a strawman of abandonment. No one made that claim but you. They come here because they don't get the proceedure in a timely manner. Get it now? Hence you lose as usual.
1057	1	a	"Actually, isn't it creationists who claim that the universe was created from nothing? Creationists even have a magazine formally called ""Ex Nihilo"" (changed to ""Creation"" because creationists didn't know what it meant.)"
1058	1	a	So you carry grenades and 75 pounds of gear, all while wearing camouflage fatigues and can call in an airstrike bombing?
1059	1	a	Where are those organizations with such scientific rigor? If they truly do exist, they must be in the position to understand the God of the Gaps they're worshipping has become microscopic.
1060	1	a	I don't care for the respect of utter nincompoops. I'm happy to tolerate them, but don't expect me not to laugh at them.
1061	1	a	Primarily from your side of the aisle in all arguments. You really described yourself a T.
1062	1	a	So this singularity that appeared out of no were became a greater singularity which took on perfect balance and form?
1063	1	a	Prove something besides your ignorance? Homo-erectus and Neandertals differ in cranium size, bone size, bone structure, number of bones as well as the length and width of individual bones. I can see why people are laughing at you
1064	1	a	"So you're claiming that you ""transformed"" from part of your mother to a human. So you're claiming that you were once almost your mom's arm or leg? lol! Biologically, this is simply a farce statement."
1065	1	a	Here's a novel idea - how about the right gives up the abstinence programmes (scientifically unproven) and improves access to and information on b/c to stop women having UPPs in the first place? Just a thought.
1066	1	a	You should really think about what you say before you say it. I have heard this before and its garbish, I have been around and owned guns my whole life and I have never, not even once, had the thought of getting a gun just because someone ###### me off. I would never use a gun on a person unless that person were a viable threat to my life, such as coming at me with a knife for example.
1067	1	a	Selective reading huh? Well, there is none so blind as he who will not see.
1068	1	a	Well with thinking challenged individuals like slimjim floating around it is no wonder we have a rogue agency with no oversight attacking the honest citizens. See Ruby Ridge and Waco for examples.
1069	1	a	You know you have outwitted a conservative thinker when they completely dodge the argument you have made.
1070	1	a	Now you are being insulting. Evolution makes no statments about your god. For that matter, neither does cosmology, astronomy, chemistry, physics or geology.
1071	1	a	Ah yes resort to attack when you have no case - perfect example. Its a marvellous demonstration of projection.
1072	1	a	So if a jew tells a big nose joke, he's saying that all jews have big noses? This is a joke thread; I posted a joke, get over it.
1073	1	a	"And you have just described ""creation science."" No application of the scientific method. No testing. The conclusions are known before the judicious quoting of scientific authority has even begun. I notice that you use one of those quotes of a scientific authority below. You show that you are what you decry."
1074	1	a	Functioning? The fetus breathes freely? It cries when it is hungry or uncomfortable? It demands attention? It smiles and coos and is cute to those who behold it?  Wow! Didn't know that fetuses were that active and functional.
1075	1	a	i dont like watching videos. or following steps. isnt there just one thing i could do? you know, like be forgiven or whatever?
1076	1	a	They can't, if you value science and common sense, however, science and common sense are irrelevent in their world.
1077	1	a	I don't see how you figure that. Are you intoxicated by any chance? I'm not trying to insult you, I'm serious. You're not writing well, and I'm not refering to your point either.
1078	1	a	Ahh but what if all the shirts have only american flags on them. Would it them be a group of patiotic americans and their children? I mean you do tend to see american flag wear, including tee shirts, everywhere. Would it still be considered a protest if all of them had american flag shirts on them.  AHHHH Joe I it hit me of course this is like Ghandis' salt march.
1079	1	a	Thank you for this thoughtful exposition on the historicity of your loving mentor.
1080	1	a	You jsut don't get it. You act like two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch. You as a hetero get to go and get married to the person of your choice but I do not. What part of that do you not understand. You say this isn't personal and for you this is true but for me the man I love is nothing but a stranger to me in the eyes of the law. How cruel can you be
1081	1	a	Er . . . how do you know that god hasn't told anyone to kill enmasse (in the last 2000 years)? Does he run all his orders by you?
1082	1	a	Where? I don't see it. My monkey brain's fine but my eyes aren't what they used to be.  I'm guessing we're through discussing the legality of armed self-defense in Australia given the flurry of OT links?
1083	1	a	Oh, if we only had the requisite absolute civilian gun bans, sick things like this would never happen! Huh Brady?
1084	1	a	Maybe you aren't aware, but something that hasn't happend but has a possibility or probability of happening is potential, so the word is accurate to describe it. And since I'm sure Steeeeve (the dictionary worshipper) will step in, here is the definition:
1085	1	a	So your biased reading of the Bible coupled with your personal flaws and your misunderstanding of science is the basis of your religiosity? Somehow I don't think that's something you'd really want to brag about...
1086	1	a	Well then, I guess I must be a turkey-sandwich worshipper! emoticonXAngel
1087	1	a	But I thought it was the easy gun laws in the U.S. that made Mexico's cities a shooting gallery? Same as L.A. and less than D.C.?   Amid Drug War, Mexico Less Deadly Than Decade Ago
1088	1	a	Again he was under attack. Listen to yourself. And talk about a parrot?   No one is arguing Saddam was a saint. But he wasn't and threat and he wasn't insane enough to commit sucide.

1091	1	a	So? God also says he made you out of dirt and then supernaturally lifting the dirt from the ground into the woman's uterus. Oh well, I suppose it is all beliefs no matter how silly it sounds.
1092	1	a	well there is an educated answer :) thanks for the feedback
1093	1	a	That is a completely subjective assessment. Thelmoose and Unkerpaulie were already quick to dissociate themselves from any smugness or self righteousness on this very thread.   It's a schism! I'm filing for their excommunication! emoticonXWow
1094	1	a	You should watch where you cast stones, kido. Your original post is an example of a straw man...not mine. You should be more careful before operating a gun...you just yourself in the foot. LOL!
1095	1	a	Damn, had 2 of them on my doorstep yesterday. Why didn't I think of that?
1096	1	a	You are apparently unwilling to extend your thinking process to the other side of the argument Galileo, and by this I mean, and repeat that it isn't criminals owning hand guns which we defenders of gun rights are fighting for. WE AGREE THAT CRIMINALS SHOULDN'T BE ARMED, and the laws already exist on the books to punish them when convicted criminals are caught with guns. But your solution to disarm all honest citizens in the belief that this will make them unavailable to criminals also is ludicrous to the point of self destructive insanity. It is that premise which we are fighting against through the NRA and other lobbying efforts.
1097	1	a	From the threads I see, you would be banned in 10 posts, and everything deleted. The level of discourse over there intelligence over there makes ER looks semi-intelligent.
1098	1	a	So the Establishment Clause was included to promote atheism, eh?
1099	1	a	None... unless she uses abortion as a form of birth control and has them regularly.
1100	1	a	well, then why are the doctors trying 2 also test the embyonic cells? what's their reason then? we don't know, because the doctors might not want everything that they're doing be on the front page of every newspaper. they have their reasons for their actions, and they just don't want people like you to know about them. or...they already have their reasons published and everything and you're just 2 close-minded 2 take the information in.
1101	1	a	That's right, a broken clock tells the right time twice a day, and gun hating hoplophobes are never right.
1102	1	a	Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing as you make unfounded claims without supporting them with even the slightest proof. But hey, talks cheap; and you've proven you've got plenty of that since showing up here.
1103	1	a	...that is on every single one of his posts? Still going to claim you read other peoples stuff properly?
1104	1	a	And I suppose you feel it would've been better if she died at the hands of a knife-wielding killer?
1105	1	a	I know this may seem obvious to most people, but it seems to have escaped the notice of creationists. Birds are tetrapods, as are amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Birds didn't just grow wings. Wings are adaptions of the front limbs that were covered with feathers. Perhaps you are unaware of the evidence that indicates that maniraptors had feathers, probably for thermoregulation. Saying that there is no mechanism for birds to grow wings when they previously had none is like saying that there is no mechanism for mankind to grow arms when he previously had none. You see, mankind's closest relatives are the two species of chimpanzee - they are quadrupeds.
1106	1	a	Well you'd know fascist wingnuts for sure. Hitting a meeting tonite?
1107	1	a	Yawn.. you are so obsessed with gay sex. I am not. Enough said.
1108	1	a	Oh, yea. You are damn right those European socialists are dangerous. Americans might look and see their governments actually doing something USEFUL for the people and think that we should have that here.   I am surprised we have not nuked them yet.
1109	1	a	WHAT??? Jito, are you saying that motherhood is difficult? emoticonXWow Now that's a shock...
1110	1	a	Did you even read ythe OP? Did you even read the title?   Pointless distinction? Huh.   I understand what you are saying. I also know you are changing your argument. When it was proven that Sanford did indeed run on family values, you changed your argument. Instead of just owning up and admitting that, you weasel out of it.
1111	1	a	"You would not celebrate Osama being out of the picture? Maybe not throw a party, but a not even a simple ""yippee!""?   Yeah, right. What a load."
1112	1	a	But there seem to be so darn many of them, everywhere you look among the religious right. Why is that? Can't they go out and recruit people with IQs somewhat above room temperature?
1113	1	a	You should use the same quote when whining about use of partial quotes, and not introduce different ones. Nozza made a false assertion and was refuted with his own words. You introduce a different false assertion and fail. Epically.
1114	1	a	Could you avoid your constant use of strawman`s fallacies please?
1115	1	a	Then you would have to be believe that out of the supposed millions upon millions of people who walked the Earth none of them were pregnant and there were no newborns either. Then again, to be Christian, you also have to believe the world was created in 7 days and their was a Biblical great flood too. The best part about writing a fairytale is that the author gets to make up everything as they go along.
1116	1	a	Yes, some people are jumping ship, which is a crying shame. STICK TO YOUR GUNS MEN! WE'RE WINNING!
1117	1	a	Want to know how to make a gay sex liberal mad and whine? Tell him the truth.  Then they get their knickers in a wad and whine for the politically correct policeman.  p.s. Unless Mother Theresa repented she will not have gone to heaven either.
1118	1	a	Sorry, I was busy looking at your Base21 source, the one where you post your own article. I figured someone had made up an article on it.   Hey, according to PNC=WW3, if I don't like the people who put the information into the State Dept. website, I don't have to believe it. That's according to him.
1119	1	a	But you are the accuser. I've read the Bible and I have studied religion, more than you can imagine. I have also studied biology, performed experiments and reached conclusions. The problem is that you seem unable to think for yourself.
1120	1	a	"You say some of us are lying and then you say you apologize ""if"" we're ""somehow"" offended. Gee, that's mighty white of you."
1121	1	a	You're right it'll be fighting the war in Iraq. )Nah, really it'll be from social security, etc etc.
1122	1	a	Too late. I am a child of the 70's. My mind evaporated decades ago.emoticonXDonno
1123	1	a	Thats why I say my gayness is His gift and blessing to me. There is nothing more joyous then gay sex.
1124	1	a	You missed out mean-spirited, which fits like a very well fitting glove.
1125	1	a	Which ones? Ineffective how?   I'd guess the laws weren't struck down simply because too many people broke them.
1126	1	a	glad to know you bring spelling into this. Shows where you are in the argument. And where did the life saving question come from?
1127	1	a	I disagree. Well, only in that I think it's high time we held everybody to a higher standard. We should suspend hetero marriage until they clean up their act!
1128	1	a	Oh gosh, silly, silly me, not blaming an entire group of people for something a few nutjobs did. My, I'm so embarassed for being so intolerant and thinking that! emoticonXBangheademoticonXBanghead
1129	1	a	I don't know? How about a person from a group known to do almost anything to get money, but also realises the pain they would bring to a child if they had one.
1130	1	a	You still don't get it do you, Smiley... emoticonXBanghead   If cupcakes were human? It would.
1131	1	a	Every time the KKK burns a cross NRA members are there. So what? Every time they burn a cross Christianity is there.
1132	1	a	Try the ( Law of Common Sense) . If your an ex-atheist, you already know the ( Law of Relativity ).
1133	1	a	"First off, no one says that if there is evil, there can't be a God. They say that if there's evil, then God can't be omnipotent and all benevolent. Let's keep the topics straight. Also, I see no way in which the existence of good bolsters the argument that God exists. I could posit the existence of a God of popcorn, and then say ""look, here's some popcorn, my God must be real!"" Somehow, I don't think that would convince you."
1134	1	a	Lotsa gay animals out there, man. Wonder what Jaaaman's sources are. He seems very perturbed by homosexuality.
1135	1	a	Good observation! He is very good at presenting fellatious viewpoints and lack of knowledge and content. He is one of the more fellatious people I know and you won't find him taking notice of the Constitution as the Supreme Law of the Land either.
1136	1	a	"You can take a horse to water. I provided evidence to support my assertion. You provided ............ ""Oh no it isn't!"""
1137	1	a	probably because this is an abortion forum and not a forum about the Iraq War..not only that, there is no parallel.
1138	1	a	So you evolved and the aryan race was created by God? I have never heard that before.
1139	1	a	I'm not interested in who isn't hitting on you. Do you want an ugly, flaming, gay cellulite blubber-wench hitting on you for three years or not??? Or maybe a pod of those whales all hitting on you??  For the record, gays make normal men's skin crawl, and not in a good way. So keep the spiritually-challenged heathens out of the men's barracks, and out of their showers. Just because you and the rest of the pro-gay crowd thinks that kind of depraved activity is ok doesn't mean the rest of society does.
1140	1	a	Of course you don't. It's the natural humanistic way of thinking.
1141	1	a	Jyoshu, stop drinking the Kool-Aid before your brain is totally fried.
1142	1	a	So taking peoples rights away is an american value? I think I will push for legislation to make cancer surgery illegal. After all cancer cells are human life too and with modern medical tech they could become a human being also.
1143	1	a	Will the Catholics ever elect somebody who is not a complete knob? He speaks just like he knows something about gay relationships. emoticonXRolleyes
1144	1	a	You never bought something you liked? You never went somewhere with someone you liked or went to meet them?
1145	1	a	It is supported, I have shown that it is true. Your only argument is to claim that organisations that perpetrate genocide don't agree that it is genocide. Wow what an argument you have.
1146	1	a	Oh, oh, and don't forget to include the proposed Federal Kosher Amendment's text, which just coincidentally matches the Levitical proscriptions, in your argument that things like the FMA have nothing to do with separation of church and state.
1147	1	a	And here it is, corrected to remove that little hint of sensationalism that you feel is needed to drum up support for your cause.
1148	1	a	Only in the mind of a secular humanist atheist would it make sense. emoticonXGood
1149	1	a	What, you mean like this story (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3136266.stm) of scientists warning about ocian acidity levels from 2003? Global warming is old news too: it doesn't seem to have reached the more remote parts of the world though, like North America for example.
1150	1	a	So if I go out and buy a Brand X car and then regret it a year later, does that mean that nobody should be allowed to go out and buy a Brand X car? Am I entitled to have an opinion and share it with others...sure. However, could others purchase a Brand X car and never regret it...absolutely. Should my negative experience be used to prevent others from engaging in something that they might consider positive? Sounds kinda fascist to me.
1151	1	a	Turned?  What do you mean turned?  (Oh man! Got you one more time! Brutal! lol)
1152	1	a	"As compared to ""Truth"" (capital T). Yes, creationist theocrats have this tendency to portray their subjective beliefs as truth, their wishful thinking as facts. No surprise there."
1153	1	a	This remark would be funny if you didn't actually mean it....
1154	1	a	Based on what besides your own immediate knee-jerk denials?  You're always in the tank for the Bible bashers.
1155	1	a	Abortion is not immoral? End of story? Simone, are you trying to impose your own personal moral code upon me? Well I never....
1156	1	a	pay attention to what ? to the voices in your head ?   your age is irrelevant to your recognized lack of intelligence, but being a minor would be relevant since it would excuse your ignorance.  My advice to you ?  keep all your life pretending in forums that you are just a kindergarten kid and therefore people would think that for a 4 year old kid you are not too dumb and of course knowing nothing is understandable.
1157	1	a	I truly mourn for you cookie. I pity the emptiness and shallowness of your soul. emoticonXCry
1158	1	a	Brave words. Next they'll be limiting free speech. Oh wait. Done that already.
1159	1	a	Indeed true. God created man in his own likeness and man returned the favor. Man created a vindictive, vengeful, and vicious god, according to the Bible. So where does a loving god come from?
1160	1	a	Right. Catholics say prayers to a woman that they hate. Next!
1161	1	a	ROFL you don't even believe that given the democrat party's known escapades. I do hope you haven't stroked out due to the Brown victory. Let the games begin!
1162	1	a	You really don't get it. The best thing about a free market is when someone acts like a fool they get burned. Thanks to government intervention and regulation when someone acts like a fool they get bailed out.   If you like we can have the trains run like Amtrak.
1163	1	a	Oh no an open minded church that doesn't hate? GASP! And sorry but the bible has many interpretations as is clearly seen in the WIDE and VAST amount of differing denominations. Just because their not closes binded right wing bigots doesn't mean you can grill them cause their interpretation is different...
1164	1	a	"Just out of interest, which particular aspect of ""truth"" are you getting at here?"
1165	1	a	Ah yes, the 'Let's pull a smug and self serving quote out of context from the bible and use it as in insult, therefore god exist' routine. That arrogant method of using self congratulatory bible quotes to insult and denigrate your opponent is neither an effective debate technique, or does it help convince those people on the boarder line to convert to Christianity. It does drive them away, so please, be my guest and keep on trying to use it. I figure the ratio of people you drove away from Christianity to those people who were converted to Christianity from you must be way lop sided.
1166	1	a	"Interesting.... have you ever been to a schoolyard recently? I think the ""taunts"" are more directed at gays. Like ""f@ggot"" and ""fairy"". What taunts do you get on a daily basis? What... being called out on your negativity towards the rights of a minority? boo hoo."
1167	1	a	But that is how creationism works - half truth. Evolution is a theory but don't make it quite clear that in science the word theory doesn't mean half-assed guess, as it does in creationism. Check out that little piece of **** that was added to the bottom of the Patterns of Cumulative Change paragraph on page 7. That is pure YEC. And you aren't a YEC?
1168	1	a	I think we're seeing a culture war. Hardly seems a fair fight though, since only one side has any.:p
1169	1	a	You'd have to drown a few puppies too. Kittens might do, but you might fall a little short.
1170	1	a	I believe we have a human responsibility to one another. That we are our brother's keeper. Tell me, Bassman, if there aren't enough jobs, and the costs of medical care are skyrocketing through the roof, what do you suggest your fellow Americans do? Just drop dead?
1171	1	a	Oh boy,,.. I got ignored with a potty remark. Why is that not surprising?
1172	1	a	"Why do ""they"" want it to be true? Some ""gay"" science agenda?"
1173	1	a	Seems all the drills would broadcast when they had a leftie. Just could wait for that case of M-1 thumb or the hot one down the shirt.
1174	1	a	So, you have no problem with the fact that this is abortion and was caused by god?
1175	1	a	Well, you're writing from an embryo's point of view, when an embryo doesn't even have a point of view. It would be like writing from a rock's point of view.
1176	1	a	I didn't know that doctors have the constitutional right to perform abortions. What provision in the Constitution guarantees that right?
1177	1	a	Well that lets out most of the supreme court when RvW comes up! And of course 1/2 give or take of the voters would be disqualified if relevant issues come up to a vote. Perhaps we should start an effort to amend the constitution to incorporate your idea!
1178	1	a	I see you missed the entire point of my post. Good job on analyzing the sarcastic opening though.
1179	1	a	Wow! ...... If your interpretation were correct, there would be a connection between his post and the USSR! But it's not, and there isn't.
1180	1	a	Oh, I see. So America does not care for the rights of the people? America cares only for the opinion of the majority? Hrm, that's funny. I fail to remember learning that part in all my US history classes. When did the founding fathers say that? Where in the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, or the Bill of Rights might I find such a notion?  'Rouge
1181	1	a	Is there some sort of a symbolic potent phallic aspect to holding a gun in one's hand? Is Sarah Palin being a manly sort when she shoots a wolf from a helicopter?
1182	1	a	What does spelling have to do with your own opinion? Again this isn't just about you although I think you did resort to correcting someone's spelling and just didn't answer the question. This has nothing to do with being entitled to your own opinion. It is equally bad for anyone to resort to personal attacks on either side of the debate.
1183	1	a	"So then how do you know that abortion isn't in the plan then? If as you say we have ""VERY LIMITED PERSPECTIVE"""
1184	1	a	since when has religion been pragmatic or based upon systems that works?  Obvious answer: never.
1185	1	a	A nameless face to the feds? In this era of paranoia and fear and overgrown governments? As if any of us are private and unknown individuals anymore.
1186	1	a	The poor in the US certainly seem to eat more than the rich in most countries.
1187	1	a	Hey Jitobaby - if you're that insecure with your beliefs that you have to throw this kind of a snit when people are making a case contrary to your failed radical liberalism, then maybe you need to watch Michael Moore on TV instead of reading my posts.
1188	1	a	Now you've ruined it! You're not supposed to mention god. That's the whole idea. ID is stealth creationism. XXXXXX pretend that there is some scientific basis for the assertion that there is some sort of magical designer that is responsible for everything, but they don't say it's god. If they did that, then ID would be religion and introducing it into schools would be unconstitutional.
1189	1	a	Just because you fail to realize what the article says doesn't make what you said true. Since you seem to like logical fallacies can you reconginze which one you just committed?
1190	1	a	So your claim that no pre-existing belief is necessary is untested by you. Do you have an example of an actual non-believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them? In my experience God never appears to atheists. Funny that.
1191	1	a	So atheists are capable of goodness, love, kindness, generosity and sympathy but they have no meaning unless one conforms the the fundamentalist christian morality.
1192	1	a	Crouching Libertarian, Hidden cost. Can't pay extra expenditures get's ya penalized! No special education requirements (they are't unders state or federal control!) No requirement to moniter student progress...that seems safe.
1193	1	a	Yes...I think I would agree with you. That's what happens when you have superstition coupled with self-imposed ignorance I suppose. It's a shame!
1194	1	a	Please tell me, why did you believe your pastor, but not me? What did he say that was so convincing? And please, PLEASE, tell me what you think the Bible might not be saying that could have any bearing on this in the slightest. How can the fact that we don't know Ehosh's second cousin twice removed have any bearing on this at all, or whatever you think the Bible wasn't saying?
1195	1	a	I was hoping that talking in Old English would help him understand.
1196	1	a	Where, exactly, did the article say that bacteria exhibit intelligence????
1197	1	a	Right on! The Obama administration is a colossal financial disaster. If he doesn't have another trillion dollars to XXXX he can't do anything. Tax and spend - that's all those liberal turkeys know how to do.
1198	1	a	Compared to what? The U.S.? That would be laughable if it wasn't so serious, it is plain ridiculous. The CDC and NAS studies Tither has posted so many times still hasn't sunk it has it? There is no benefit to any gun control law that has been studied! Now here you are ignoring and contradicting scientific facts...again. Take Chicago, they have strict gun laws and have over 3 times the national rate of murders.
1199	1	a	You mean you've spent your good, hard-earned money on his revisionist follies? ROTFLOL!! You could have had a six pack to really make your day.
1200	1	a	Why does they admin let EZ post comments like this to other people, if he can't be vicl and debate like an adult to others, why is he here......to spread god's love ...right?
1201	1	a	Just which god might that be? Yahweh? Krishna? he Great Spirit? Allah?  Please specify.
1202	1	a	Looks like dancing in the blood of innocents to me.
1203	1	a	"Oh I understand plenty. What you want is a system where a person is held responsible for crimes that they didn't commit. You want ""guilty by association"" extended to the point of ridiculousness where anybody who even met the criminal even once can be held as an accomplice."
1204	1	a	Uhhhh, I just said that I DO JUDGE! So what in the hell are you talking about? You're not well. I didn't bother to adress your points about slavery because there's no point. I disagree with your claims as I suspect would most historians. But it doesn't surprise me that Christians would try to claim that they ended slavery since they also try to falsely claim they founded the country.
1205	1	a	All science is provisional. For absolutes, we look to your interpretation of your bible. That's always absolute and beyond any correction.
1206	1	a	I can understand your disappointment. Its very difficult to cure someone of chronic religious delusions. No easy way to relieve the suffering of the victim. But if you really work hard at it for another decade or so you may recover yet. Best of luck and don't fall for the quacks peddling quick cures.
1207	1	a	Oh look, Gansao the blowhard is still living in his world of ignorance and denial... like his daddy Ezridden.   You couldn't educate a rock ya stupid bastard.emoticonXBye
1208	1	a	I guess since he said so it must be true... poor daewoo, just remember only whiners point out logic fallacies like ad hominem and argument by dismissal.
1209	1	a	Are you sure? VOR is a 14 year old kid from Florida. His IP is squarely from a ISP from Florida. If he is retired, he is the first person I have ever heard who was 60+ that used slang normally reserved for street gangs. Not to mention that his war stories place him in two different seas at the same time. Somehow 2 tours turned into 4, midlevel ship officer turned into high ranking military advisor.   All in all, VOR is far more of a liability to any of his allies because of his lying, lack of education and reading comphrension problems.
1210	1	a	I have. Yet I can`t seem to be able to do the creative math that will show that europe will become pre-dominatly muslim in any near future.
1211	1	a	Evidence? We're talking religion here. Religion. If there were evidence, then it would be science.
1212	1	a	But religion is not a topic for science classes. Teach the science in class and if that presents a problem for your religion at home, perhaps you should think about your religion a bit more critically and realistically. What is being attempted is to cast doubt on well established scientific theory and pretend that magic is a viable alternative.
1213	1	a	Perhaps then the problem is a shortage of fiber in you diet?
1214	1	a	Our pumping of CO2 is certaintly not helping. Does that mean we should pump gasses and make people in big cities sneeze?
1215	1	a	"I could have labeled my post ""TRAP"" and you wouldn't notice. Tell me, are these two contradictory:"
1216	1	a	If truth makes you uncomfortable, feel free not to respond to me. I will continue to point out hypocrisy , and bigotry. I'll mock anybody who says 'slavery wasn't all that bad' either.
1217	1	a	Yes, I will mark that on my calendar for future reference.....get help man....really...you need it.
1218	1	a	Seriously, in part is Waxy saying, I was here first? (It's my forum, I'll whine if I want to.)
1219	1	a	I also took a look and think your evaluation is charitable.
1220	1	a	Actually they apologised because it's a bit of a fad amongst the limp-wristed politicians at the moment. And anyway, the blood is fairly even on both sides.
1221	1	a	"Ah yes, the ever popular 3rd grade ""they started it"" response. Didn't jesus say to turn the other cheek?"
1222	1	a	Care to post some proof or should everyone just believe it because you say it?..
1223	1	a	You show me the post where I said I thought terrorists killing children was a good idea and I will eat my keyboard.
1224	1	a	But if this was a republican program, you'd have no problem with it. You are a rightwing hypocrite, Archie Baby.
1225	1	a	And you know what I think? I think that everyone who doesn't have sex 24 hours a day 7 days a week is denying human beings life every second. I'm sure some of those sperm would love to have the chance to breathe the air that you are breathing in vain because you don't think they should live [/sarcasm]. Why don't you think this? Why embryos? Embryos are the one thing that have great potential to cause harm in a woman, and you just so happen to choose them as human beings. Very suspicious...
1226	1	a	True they should have passed raincoats and knee boots to protect peoples clothes from the XXXX that the president was spewing out.
1227	1	a	This, coming from an atheist. How consistently shallow of you. emoticonXRolleyes
1228	1	a	yea, I often forget ToE is a mental concept, not a scientific one. Nothing -- and I mean nothing -- will ever dismantle it in the minds of the faithful. Materialism is so entrenched in your mind that even if an animal generates a new piece of morphology by mere thought, sensation or awareness, and then passes that trait down to progeny, (which has been shown on here) you still think materialism stands. It's an unfalsifiable mindset that you and millions of others have created for yourselves.
1229	1	a	Well it depends he could always be a sperm donor or make some Lesbian couple happy :)
1230	1	a	"No, I for one dislike your posts because I know you intentionally write irrational posts to help support your religious cause.   Just for the record montalban, basically every single legitimate scientist is ""pro-evolution"". Creation theory is not taught in public schools, not by chance, but because...*gasp* it's RELIGIOUS MUMBO JUMBO. There is no evidence to support it. Creation fiction has made no progress with it's ""faith-based"" (lackofevidence) with rational people.   And I'll also say that I'd welcome ad hominem over irrational thinking any day. Ad hominem is just a lack of patience, or someone who doesn't care to hide their emotion or opinion. Irrational thinking on the other hand is often only cured by death. Someone guilty of ad hominem can still hold a rational debate. The irrational..well, why bother?   -Mach"
1231	1	a	How about other religious theories. What about teaching about the sun god? I don't mean that they believed that, but teach it as a choice because everyone deserves the right to choose in what they believe. Actually let's also teach how the theory of gravity could be wrong and people can choose to believe that invisible fairys pull people down towards the Earth and other massive objects. We should teach the theory of gravity also but we need to give them the choice on what to believe.
1232	1	a	Excuse me, I stand corrected. For 'pretend' please substitute 'wrongly believe'.
1233	1	a	No surprise there. You would have to invest some thought to define something. Why don't you just consult your Little Golden Dictionary?
1234	1	a	Actually, I don't sneer at you. I laugh at you. And I don't attack your intelligence but your knowledge. You are intentionally ignorant.
1235	1	a	That sort of warms the cockles of my heart. Namely that some Europeans might be disinclined to visit or stay here. Don't let the door hit you in the buttocks on the way out.
1236	1	a	So the BBC folks are frauds and liars? You really are an idiot aren't you? Piltdown Bird is a colorful way of saying it was a Piltdown like fraud.   National Geographic knew it was a fake and published the article anyway.  Of course you probably still believe in the original Piltdown don't you?  You probably believe the Nebraska Man and Haeckels speechless apes were real too.  There is an echo when you think isn't there?
1237	1	a	Cool I want to be free of the regulation that I wash my hands before preparing other peoples food. After all it should be my choice to wash my hands after going to the restroom and I should be able to make that choice without restraint. In your world there are no courts, police, or governments to hold me accountable for killing someone or giving them hepatitis.
1238	1	a	Well bravo for you - they must not be all that good considering. Or did you simply learn to be deceptive yourself and confuse that with deception by others? Who can say?
1239	1	a	"your ""minds""? How many do you have? Oh, and ""I wanted to see what inferior it was""? Nice example of your supposed superiority."
1240	1	a	I'm glad that you're the one living in fear of becoming a criminal for defending your family and not me.
1241	1	a	I have an entire New Testament. You've got what - a mouthful of denial? When you get to the level of the NT works let us know.
1242	1	a	And you tell people not to call you a gay basher? LOLemoticonXRolleyes emoticonXRolleyes emoticonXCensored   I know very well what faux means - that is the reason it is bashing to call someone's marriage that.
1243	1	a	I won't hold my breath awaiting a retraction of this piece of balderdash you've composed. Guess we'll chalk it up to puffery.
1244	1	a	"You see, that's the problem: ""generally"". You obviously know little or nothing of how prejudice works in this country."
1245	1	a	Well, at least you are more consistent about equality than a lot of people in your movement.
1246	1	a	I know that. Evolution releases itself from its foundation at will. When it wants to speculate about things like abiogenesis and claim it to be science, it allows itself to do that. It's that interchangeability thing you spoke of above.
1247	1	a	And yet after investigating for over a year, our inspectors agree with me, not you. Hmmm.
1248	1	a	All sin undermines society, including illicit gay sex sin. Or have you forgotten Sodom and Gomorrah? Coming to a San Francisco bath house near you.

1252	1	a	"HELLO!! THAT'S WHY!! Then we see the standard dance of how innocent and objective science really is.   6) And the standard ""theistic evolution"" dance. Atheistic evolutionists can't get along without it! I wonder if Kenneth Miller will see the movie, and comment on it. I wonder if he'd have refused to be a part of it."
1253	1	a	So what you are saying is that the actual purpose of prison is to be raped in the shower by some 400 pound guy called Betty? Or brutalised by a guard with an inferiority complex...and these don't strike you as cruel and unusual?
1254	1	a	Isn't the point pretty obvious- that exposure to a gun can raise testosterone levels and trigger violent and aggressive thoughts and actions?
1255	1	a	Yea they get over it in a year or two. Haaa Haaa
1256	1	a	So you yourself could have gone gay but chose to be attracted to women?
1257	1	a	"Spain, unlike most modern democracies, very very recently had the uh.. privilege of living under a strong, ""moral"" government that supported the uh.. ""family values"" so important to the right.   That they are running like hell away from it should tell people something."
1258	1	a	"So now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?   I expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? Am I to believe that you are a soldier there now?   Your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. I posted exactly what I meant to and you went off on a tangent. I asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if ""show me yours before I show mine?"" Pitiful."
1259	1	a	Oh, sorry, I didn't think that was a serious answer. Thanks.
1260	1	a	Hehehe. Sounds like an American in a big SUV looking at $4/gallon gasoline with a maxed out credit card listening to fundamentalist talk radio.
1261	1	a	Cute. And I can come up with about 5,000 to 7,000 examples that do have a bright orange muzzle.
1262	1	a	Oh...come on Steeeeve...you know Bush is actually making it worse. After all, it is happening on Obama's watch, and we have got to have someone to blame. Bush was the president...let's just blame him. emoticonXRolleyes
1263	1	a	Judicial activism? What brand of stupid is it that you use? What judicial activism do you see here; the judge stating that open carry is legal and has been, and that you can't be arrested when you haven't committed a crime? Or that the police can be sued for damages when they choose to break the law to persecute an innocent bystander?
1264	1	a	"So you're saying that God is a ""respector""?-of-persons - iow, the mom's ""more""-important to *God*? than the unborn."

1266	1	a	And the funeral dirge of the Left and comparisons to Nazi Germany and/or the collapse of the Roman Empire will begin in 3....2.....
1267	1	a	Losing again I see. Don't change the subject. How are supporting 'gay sex debauchery' and lying in any way synonymous?  You have made the accusation. Back it up.  If different words are too much for your miniscule brain to cope with, I suggest you try yelling your hogwash on a street corner, where less people will be able to see how much of a fool you are.
1268	1	a	I'd be pretty dumb to buy something from someone who doesn't even believe in what they're selling. Those teachers may teach it, but they don't believe in it.
1269	1	a	No. Not only are you wrong, you seem to lack the integrity to learn the basics of what you claim to oppose. You oppose evolution you say, but you have no idea of what it is. Most educated creationists not only admit evolution, they propose evolution at rates that make real biologists laugh.
1270	1	a	When I want the opinion of a spiritually-dead nincompoop I'll call you.
1271	1	a	So, it's a proven fact that children denied the act of abortion suffer negative effects? Hmmmmmm
1272	1	a	"But you sure don't hesitate to portray them that way when you use one to bolster the other! Or when you fail to actually (GASP) qualify the matter by noting the differences as well as the similarities. Hey, it's just accuracy, so why get in a fuss over it, huh? emoticonXRolleyes Why not go ahead and invoke the Jewish genocide while you're at it, or call anyone who has a different opinion ""Hitler?"" I mean it's the same sort of generalization."
1273	1	a	Neat my very own living spell check I can't wait to see well it works.
1274	1	a	"Here is yet another example of Duo holding other people's arguments to a higher standard than he holds his own. Duo, you said ""Second, no one call actually tell the age of anyone here. To declare such when the verifiability that the claim depends on does not exist is sheer insanity."" Are you right? Anyone claiming to know age on these boards without evidence is insanity? Duo, if you are right, you are calling yourself insane. That's not going to help you out on the credibility meter. Perhaps you might want to amend some of you posts?"
1275	1	a	"So, I'm wondering, did you neglect to note the reason because you ""forgot"" or because it would weaken your statement and its connotation that we really didn't want him that badly? emoticonXConfused"
1276	1	a	There you go. It's difficult to find which side of your mouth to talk out of when the facts are the facts!
1277	1	a	"And there you have the ""***** Eye for the Straight Guy"" review of the inauguration. :p   Never mind the expense, the protests, the rather scary IMHO precendent Bush has set in terms of the inauguration, let alone his foreign policy, let's talk about Laura Bush's outfit. emoticonXRolleyes   Waxy"
1278	1	a	It is impossible to read something that can't be found.
1279	1	a	Well Duh!   The answer has ALWAYS BEEN Drugs, and Drug Traffickers. Concentrate on them and you have the answer to the problems!
1280	1	a	How uninteresting must that be for you to intentionally spend time annoying people on the internet?
1281	1	a	NO, gun registration should not be mandatory anywhere in the US. The government has no business knowing who has a gun. Gun registration could possibly allow the government to infringe on constitutional guarantees provided by the Bill Of Rights. Just knowing that there are many Senators and Congressmen who would like to abolish gun rights gives credence to the fact that government could actually try to limit or ban the 2nd Amendment in the future.   P.S. Crazy is as Crazy says. Scary to think that some would believe that a registered gun that becomes a stolen gun would help in finding the thief or killer if that same criminal gets rid of the gun. Which, if later found, would then be traced back to the legitimate owner, who may not even know the gun had been stolen. The alibi better be outstanding!
1282	1	a	Dear smiling, friendly, forgiving Archangel:  I would be quite happy to respond to you if you could organize your incoherent mental states into logical, debatable points. Please refer to Chester's Questions for Bible-thumpers for guidelines.  As for staying on topic: since there is no God, it is rather pointless to have religious ceremonies in any case, isn't it?  As for my nom de Web, you have missed the point altogether. Either you are not quick on the uptake and/or you are completely ignorant of the Japanese language. Hint: surely you have seen the starry emblem on all Subaru cars?  To end on a conciliatory note: I entirely agree with the last sentence of your posting [except the punctuation].  -
1283	1	a	If you had a look at all of the other threads on this topic you would see that.
1284	1	a	3101 posts! what a waste of cyber real estate! at least you are brief.
1285	1	a	78.4 years? Well excuse me but I intend to live much longer than that. I was thinking about 112.7 years. Yeah. That's about right.
1286	1	a	"Again, key word ""genetic"". My hair has the genetic characteristics of a human, but that doesn't make getting a haircut murder does it?"
1287	1	a	Looks like someone couldn't grip with the fact that he was a closest racist. emoticonXCry
1288	1	a	And you offer none for your's. Heteros engage is risky business as well. Therefore on the same grounds we ban straight marriage.   It's not just STD's, it's all sorts of physical issues as well. Cancers, hepatitus, bacterial infections, that result from anal and vagina sex. Add one word and BAM, it works aganist you.
1289	1	a	You have conviced no one or even come remotely to forming an argument.
1290	1	a	So you're a perfect clone of one your parents with zero copying errors? Amazing.
1291	1	a	what other forest? By your logic there would only be one left in the entire world, and it would be what, the size on central park?
1292	1	a	That's ok, cause it's completely legal to light up a cigarette while driving. I guess some feel that must be a lot safer than using a phone.
1293	1	a	Ahh Good old (and I mean OLD) Ronnie. This man doesn't know XXXX about foreign policy.

1295	1	a	Thanks for what? Pointing out that you have once again misread an article? No problem, I'll be sure to keep up the effort seeing as how you apprecitate so much. emoticonXGood
1296	1	a	Oh Blah! Blah! Blah!  What the devil do Comanches know?  The sisterhood and brotherhood of Sioux, Navajo, Iroquois and other sundry tribes.
1297	1	a	You know, its those happy-smiley cartoons that really freak me out. Is this just me or does anyone else find them creepy?
1298	1	a	Oh? And what is the specific amount of pot you have to smoke before you become a drug crazed fiend?
1299	1	a	It's a lot easier to kill someone with a gun than a cigarette or a beer.
1300	1	a	And we have an emotional post with no substance whatsoever. I'm sure your twin will be checking in soon. I think I'll keep a count of this type of post.
1301	1	a	What's that? Campaigning and use of taxpayer funded facilities like transportation for political purposes? I suppose they paid the cops for going out of their jurisdiction too?
1302	1	a	You can try and deny the facts all you like. Here they are from the CDC for 2003, go spin them.
1303	1	a	"And of course, the theory of gravity isn't ""physically"" proven either. Neither is the heliocentric theory or atomic theory or the germ theory of disease. However, evolution has been observed to occur and the current theories are the best explanations that we have for the observations. As far as your mangling of the ""Out of Africa"" theory, it would be nice if you actually learned what you are talking about before you babble such nonsense."
1304	1	a	so your saying he was 200% god-man? i'm not a mathematician but that can't be right surley.
1305	1	a	Sorry but I don't read your posts, do you think I worship your word or something?
1306	1	a	No, I have no idea. He didn't build the Bush Library as Marc Rich did to get a pardon from Clinton, did he?
1307	1	a	How can they visually express themselves without their right to expression, besides funky hairdoos.
1308	1	a	Says the man who wants to criminalize being a victim of a crime. :)
1309	1	a	Now settle down charlie, and try to think rationally, just for a second. Have you ever heard of a tumor growing into a sentient life form as a fetus does? I'd appreciate a link documenting such an occurrence so we pro-lifers can start planning save the tumor rally's.
1310	1	a	And I was correcting you. If you are offended then that's the breaks.
1311	1	a	"So your answer to the question then is ""Nothing"", Marc?"
1312	1	a	PROJECTION, again.... I'm amazed you can't recognise the amount you do it....
1313	1	a	So did you read his mind to determine exactly why he bolded that particular set of words? You are the first mind reader I have encountered here. And considering your disdain and rejection of science from cosmology to biology what does it matter if something is terrible science. According to you all science should be terrible. Why do you attempt to use a tool which you reject as being useful?
1314	1	a	The tooth fairy has a different function than the Easter bunny.
1315	1	a	It wasn't meant as an insult...just a statement of fact. I likely have as many or more inadequacies than do you.
1316	1	a	Simone baby I'll see your Sanford and raise you a Mark Spitzer, John Edwards, Jim McGreevey and of course the king of sleeze der slickmeister Willie.
1317	1	a	"Yippie doo! A 23 year old quote from an ornithologist defending his point of view. And his point of view has (or had) merit. But since then, several feathered dinosaurs (not birds) have been found. It has also been shown that the difference between a scale and a feather may be no more than a single point mutation. (You do know what I'm talking about, don't you Calli? You do know what a ""point mutation"" is, don't you?) Bottom line is that there may be no intermediate between scales and feathers. A single point mutation produces feathers from scales. Various kinds of feathers require only further mutation."
1318	1	a	"Not true. I googled ""helpful mutation"" and got a nice list of examples. I wish creationists would do some research before making wild assertions."
1319	1	a	Your god sees no degree of sins. Shaving your beard, baby-rape, etc, are all punishable by death. That is, unless you repent. emoticonXBanghead
1320	1	a	I suspected as much, well part of my job then is to ignore and make snide comments to people who don't come to debate :)
1321	1	a	Now name one country with universal socialized healthcare with a population of 300 million citizens modulus, just one if you can. Your exemplar countries are tiny in comparison to us so lets get realistic and compare apples to apples for once, ok?
1322	1	a	So, a forty year old having sex with a twelve year old is ok then?
1323	1	a	Thank You. You know how much I love to impress people.
1324	1	a	This is often called: 'talking out of both sides of your mouth'
1325	1	a	Tell us Brady, does the information that While Males ratified the 13th and 14th put a twist in your knickers? emoticonXSmilie
1326	1	a	Sounds like my 9mil. is more secure under my bed in hands reach.
1327	1	a	What is your theory about the foot fetish gene ?
1328	1	a	Well that's fine because I don't really listen to lunatics insult me too much either...
1329	1	a	If I thought you'd understand in the least bit why it's important to scrutinize possible occupants of the White House, I'd explain how I feel about. However, you are a hopeless case.
1330	1	a	Half of the country is stupid enough to think that four (or eight) more years of Dumbya would be good.
1331	1	a	No, but they will be forced to have babies if they have sex.
1332	1	a	To summarize, since penfolds reasoning has been shown to be both ignorant and short sighted, his only recourse is to offer a trollish quip before skulking away like the irrational philosophical coward that he is. At least you're consistent penfold. emoticonXRolleyes
1333	1	a	See, a terrorist attack is probably the sort of thing I would use as an excuse to not go to work...
1334	1	a	do you go to study hall? probably not. It is a requirement where the athletes sign in and sit in the library with their teams and are monitored to make sure that their studying is getting done.
1335	1	a	Well I am polishing my grave dancing shoes as these people in their 70's can not live forever.
1336	1	a	what about God? So many God-fearing people, he must be a terrorist :)  seriously I really don't know much about terrorists. I know that Bin Laden was behind 9/11 but he wasn't the only one, but that's about it.
1337	1	a	Are you like a Chinese government official or something? Oh wait. I forgot, the Chinese government controls what you say anyway, so I guess it matters not.
1338	1	a	So you are truthful, but I am a liar. Just like you are clever, but I am stupid. You have no respect for me, WW; I've never seen you demonstrate respect for anyone.
1339	1	a	So they haven't gone into bankruptsy yet? I guess the illegal loans are helping after all. emoticonXRolleyes
1340	1	a	Actually in terms of populations we're the same people as the Irish. If you want tyranny try the oppression of the Native Americans. Did you know that the Natives and the blacks were both on the British side during the War of Independence? Amazing how we tyrants command such free support huh....
1341	1	a	No, you can go on the public dole and have the rest of us hard-working Americans wipe your arse for you or you can buy your own or be fined for not doing so.
1342	1	a	So if it's not human, we can kill it? But I dare say that's a different topic completely. Sorry, that was more along animal rights than abortion. Abortion is this for me: If the baby is going to endanger the mother's life as well as the baby, why endanger the baby and the mother? Sticking on the decided path, would you rather kill something you know is human, or something that you're not sure is human. It sounds a bit cruel and I didn't intend it to be that way at all. It's just that one loss would hard enough, why make it two?
1343	1	a	It's ironic that you should talk about lack of evidence. At least we have a source to believe.
1344	1	a	Why would I worry about a book of myths and fairy tales?
1345	1	a	"Amusing coming from someone who falsely claimed another user misused the term ""light year.""   If I am so ignorant, explain how your argument does not require exactly what I said: That God operated the named light sources on a very different set of physical laws and removed all evidence of their existence to meld them with the current set of physical laws that we know do not support young Earth Creationism.   I'm betting you don't even understand your original argument. Prove me wrong. Explain how it does not result in God being a liar."
1346	1	a	Gee right on schedule here's the other half of the comic relief. Get a job and a life and off the dole. PS I think mum would be happy to see you out of her basement too.
1347	1	a	Where is the government in this? Clinicians made a clinical decision, and hid behind a non-mandatory guideline, which was set by other more senior clinicians, expert in their field. Assuming the woman's very detailed recall of the stressful series of events is accurate, perhaps it was God's way of telling this unmarried mother that after five previous miscarriages, she still wasn't getting the message.
1348	1	a	Did I mention premarital or adulterous heterosexual sex?  I think not!  As usual 'big' boy is putting words in others posts!  Was better when I was on his ignore list..for about five minutesemoticonXConfused
1349	1	a	Yeah, but now the special interests won't have access to congress' deep pockets emoticonXRolleyes (hopefully)
1350	1	a	Gee, and in what year did he state that? 2005? No way. 2000? No. 1995? Nope. 1990? Nah. 1985? Couldn't be. Without more information I can give an exact date, but seeing as how Simpson died in 1984, he must have said that at least 21 years ago (and if he said it in the middle of his life/career, it would have been more like 60 years ago!) - he did not know back then what we now know.
1351	1	a	Within one post.   Thanks for proving that creationist are incapable of discussing the original topic and automatically move to change the subject.
1352	1	a	I see you know nothing about the subject...hardly a surprise.
1353	1	a	Feel free samiinh. After all, chemist asked me the same question just yesterday pertaining to the same subject. And the same question about being angry at an allegedly non existent God applies to you too.
1354	1	a	LOL! Dodging the problem Easyrider. So, is sidestepping the best you can do?
1355	1	a	No, not at all. Read the post above. 'Christmas cracker'?? What's that? Here, we have Fortune cookies.:)
1356	1	a	Everyone is welcome to give their opinion on public gun possession here-whether you're for or against gun control (or does gun possession justifies itself) and please state the reasons as well. I would really appreciate it if you guys could include some extra informations regarding this issue.
1357	1	a	What's sick is your theological comprehension.  God took Ananias and Sapphira (Acts chapter 5) off the earth just for lying. And you want to give JFK, the serial adulterer, a pass? That's how lame your theological thinking is.

1362	1	a	Stalin died of natural causes while in power, I believe. Perhaps the fall of communism is due in part that the purges stopped. So, killing hundreds of thousands of people was wise for Stalin, huh? Good. Good. Anybody disagree with canadianman76?
1363	1	a	Modest as well I see. You haven't answered my question at all. If you are going to wander into a thread like this and make such a comment as follows:
1364	1	a	Haven't we all . The difference is some of us know that most people have or will and that it does not make us a fount of knowledge. As you show us so well.

1371	1	a	Is your thinking really this simplistic? Either I have to agree with you or I am an anarchist? Is that all the complexity you can handle? This or that? Black or white? The best soda in the world is Sprite and everything else is wrong? What a boring little pigeon-holed world you live in.  No harm no foul - that is where I stand on sex and romance. Kids, animals and those who don't or can't consent are off-limits. K? Now that I have established (AGAIN) how I feel on that matter, let me reinstate.  Any God that allows love and intimacy for only a select group is viscious.
1372	1	a	Thanks god we sorted that out! I mean, the whole South America - Africa thing is just a coincidence right? Right?
1373	1	a	Ha. Those must be the same folks who believe in the missing link like you do.

If it is what it is all about, if you marry a woman who is incapable of having children, even with scientific methods, then you are not really married?   What about lesbians? They can have childre, with a little help from the local sperm bank. In facst, they can BOTH get pregnant. Does tht mean that a marriage between 2 lesbians is twice as valid?   What if a couple of gay men adopt? Then is their marriage valid?   If I have a vasectomy, am I divorced?   You are confusing me. Please explain.
1390	1	a	"Well....it was easier to get them to use those rather than the ones that just said ""White trash onboard""......."
1391	1	a	"Just to be pedantic, a better analogy would be: ""If you are here, why do you have brothers and sisters?"""
1392	1	a	"So if you quoted Ted Kennedy when he said to his wife in an event that wasn't even publicized ""Good morning, sweetie"", that would be an answer?"
1393	1	a	Was your pretty graph supposed to convince me that the universe can't be understood? Perhaps I was to intuitively understand that you're right :p
1394	1	a	More heretical misinformation from dear old cap0.   'Zionism is Racism' - a Dead Issue
1395	1	a	That's it? That was your post? To attack a source without anything backing you up? Bravo!
1396	1	a	Try and comprehend this child, your siggy is your OPINION. It is evidence of nothing real or imagined. Only in your mind does it prove anything at all.
1397	1	a	But on the other hand, Genesis isn't a scientific document. No wonder. Why would a bronze age nomad from the Levant be aware of at least 3 tailless species of primates, or even the tailed primates from Africa, South America, and even Madigascar. If they aren't mentioned in the Bible, do they exist?
1398	1	a	"Because the soundbite ""survival of the fittest"" was coined to explain evolution to the stupid masses."
1399	1	a	Well if you are Catholic you would should probably find him pretty credible.
1400	1	a	let's have an up or down vote on your marriage rights too Lurch.....
1401	1	a	And irrational emotional appeals seldom hold up in the face of logic
1402	1	a	oh cc, apparently, 10% of the population has the power to destroy the other 90% somehow. We can't be in the military because we have the power to undermine things, we can't get married cause we will destroy marriage for everyone, we cannot possibly have committed relationships because it would make Britney look bad ( although, I have her beat by 4 years and counting, still happy and going) We have the power. We are gay, ten percent taking out the other 90% or so they say (ask jaaman for more info)
1403	1	a	Yes yes yes. We know you are bigoted against any non-christian. I am sure that the out of context quotes are totally misrepresenting Islam. But, your out of context quotes totally misrepresent Judaism too.. so that is no surprise.
1404	1	a	It's sophomoric remarks like that that hurt the gay cause in America.   God isn't mocked, though. And I doubt the people are either.   And I'm glad California outlawed the sin. The only thing you have left is to hope the far left, spiritually-stunted judges in the US Supreme Court are pro Sodom and Gomorrah.
1405	1	a	Big Bear, ye mae be thinkin' o the Mennonites. Er the Hutterites, er the Amish. Er mebbe the followers of thet Zwingli feller.
1406	1	a	Tell me then, does someone who is mentally retarded have a self-interest in staying alive? What about someone in a coma?
1407	1	a	I find it funny you think Article V was repealed yet the bill of rights references Article V for passage.   So we have the bill of rights which can't be repealed but Article V which was repealed meaning all the amendments we had are unconstitutional? You've really lost it haven't you.
1408	1	a	Has the American Medical Association decided to recognize that aluminum, steel and polymer and addictive narcotic substances that can drastically alter a person's mental status?
1409	1	a	Observations? Like the posts I have made? Which would be documented via quotes?....emoticonXConfused You demanded 'links' for your recurring rudeness, I produced them. I demand 'links' for my creationism.
1410	1	a	It's also hard to convince a rational person that something is so if there is zero evidence of its truth, but then you wouldn't have any clue about that.
1411	1	a	I think we should not only allow GAYs to have legal marriage rights but also those who want to practice insist as well as all who want to practice polygamy. Let us not stop there let us sanction union between human and animals. After all I love my Dog and my Parrot. Why stop with GAYs?   By the way where does the term GAY come from for homosexuals.
1412	1	a	Are you going to go and urinate on his grave as well?  My! My! What hatred and vitriol! What does it feel like to have so black a heart?
1413	1	a	have you considered a career in advertising?  by the way you f***ed us too. Australians troops were cannon fodder in WWI for the British Empire, remember Gallipoli?
1414	1	a	Actually, I read that the god of the bible was really a macaroni monster. He likes cheese, too.
1415	1	a	What's the matter? Can't anybody in KC afford to have 2 cars? emoticonXWow
1416	1	a	So...all Christians have some sort of brain damage, trebor? You're not getting any better at this are you?
1417	1	a	Wow Archie, way to suck the fun out of something. Let me use your words here:
1418	1	a	Alexander, I don't give a rat's rectum about King James. emoticonXBanghead
1419	1	a	No, actually, we don't.   I suppose it's pointless to ask someone who would speak for God to not tell me what I know.
1420	1	a	O.K. lets' play your game. Gun control has worked exactly WHERE?
1421	1	a	"I don't understand your outrage. McChrystal's your boy's general now. Are you saying that you disagree with ""the Great One""?"
1422	1	a	It appears the safety Nazis feel gun free zones should be ran like prisons. Maybe the safety Nazis should take a field trip to their states prison system and ask the guards if guns or any other weapons ever make it into the prisons. Prisons are considered gun and drug free zones. If this was true then how can an inmate get shot by a gun in prison?
1423	1	a	"Plenty. You haven't noticed how many ""sentences"" you post that aren't sentences?"
1424	1	a	Nor is there any need for some mythical molecular elemental, nebulas natural selection, or mystical transitionals based on peicemeal forensics and antithestic rhetoric.
1425	1	a	The egg is now a conscious human? In under 72-hours? Wow.
1426	1	a	You actually posted something that made good sense, and was funny too, maybe there hope for you yet.
1427	1	a	point me toward the right way then? if creationists are wrong then why is evolution right? this is a biased answer based on your beliefs. please tell us how creationists were wrong. i would gladly like to see you try!
1428	1	a	And you, on the other hand, because you are not educated in science in general, and evolutionary theory (why the quotation marks?) specifically, are qualified to correct those of us who spent years in study of the topic.
1429	1	a	John/John would figure out a way for the American taxpayers to foot the bill.
1430	1	a	You mean to tell me you would deny a life to be lived out and someone to get away with a harmful crime?? wow, sounds like a liberal to me..
1431	1	a	Did you even notice that they were not the first to report it? Oh wait, you didn't because you are obviously using the fallacy of selective observation.
1432	1	a	All the more reason to be armed to the teeth huh,does this mean you see it our way?
1433	1	a	No, think about what you just said. A cancer cell doesn't mutate, it attacks healthy cells and causes the destruction of healthy tissue. Kinda like liberals in a healthy society - they are the free radicals of the body politic, huh... go figure.
1434	1	a	And Anarchy. Am I allowed to kill someone if I feel like it ?
1435	1	a	Sounds like an abortion bill amendment to restrict all travel by minors is needed by those demanding that young girls give birth after being impregnated by rapists, fathers, uncles, etc. Might as well include adults, just to simplify matters and enhance state police power. Bubbah will be pleased.
1436	1	a	For someone that knows how each side thinks, I would have thought you would have had an eye opening response that would have had me recanting everything I have said in the past and glorifying your name and everything you would say in the future, BUT, instead I got
1437	1	a	Now that is a diaper load. How's that free speech thing doing up there by the way.
1438	1	a	I see. Sounds too nebulous to stand up to scrutiny in the US. I'm guessing that the SCOTUS would strike down such as law as being too vague.
1439	1	a	Ahhh I see so God was more than willing to use extreme punishment for not loving your neighbor. Like how Sodom and Gomorrah were punished for not loving their neighbor.
1440	1	a	I guess the European union is a great failure? Is that why the Euro is trending 1.5 dollars as liberalism creats misery?
1441	1	a	So now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to Old Testament practices are considered left wing? What's this world coming too? LOL
1442	1	a	I was eight at the time. I'll read up and get back to you. Mind your manners.
1443	1	a	Hmm.. does that include the Muslim Communities you were associated with too?.. We know as rational people that Denial is the Christians best weapon. You should seriously consider increasing your medications..
1444	1	a	Yes but your one of those Christians people hear about, but never find. You don't really exist. :)
1445	1	a	so you are into pommy bashing now? mae honey, is there anybody you don't like? emoticonXRolleyes
1446	1	a	So cross jurisdictional escort is a fairly common occurrence in the area. You will note that it is not the local cops talking about not being informed....it is the author of the article whining about it.
1447	1	a	...Because everyone knows there are no married men sexually abusing children. emoticonXConfused
1448	1	a	"Well, the pill has the ability to not let it implant, which ""God"" already cause for around 60% of its contemporaries. The pill doesn't destroy the ""entity"" at all."
1449	1	a	Oh.. that makes sense. Because, it sounds exactly like modern day republicans.
1450	1	a	But apparently they can't say no to renting the property for a gay wedding, even if they decide to just say 'no' to everyone and get out of business. go figure
1451	1	a	Good to know that sence of humor hasn't completely evaded you.   Had me worried there for a moment, or two, or three... emoticonXWow
1452	1	a	oh do tell us of this dooms day event, will we need new nike sneakers and $1.75 in our pocket when we all die?
1453	1	a	Never heard of him...however, looks like those ever-loving proponents of free speech up in Canada showed Anne Coulter that 'free-speech' is Only what liberals make it to be.....
1454	1	a	Whose culture are we talking about, here?  I thought I was a member of the culture. What am I, chopped liver?
1455	1	a	Well, good, I'm glad as heck you have a mom you can tell that to. Mine would've hit the roof, and then hit me on the way back down. Did she flip or was she pretty cool about it?  Just remember (who would we be if not preachy? Us ol' adults, we don't know nuthin') that b.c. isn't one hundred percent reliable or that condoms can break and you can still get nasty bugs all kinds of different ways.
1456	1	a	So everything that other people say on a website or in a book is just and opinion? And everything you say is a fact? Nice how you've got things set up.
1457	1	a	It's also a noun. But since you're unable but to repeat your self, maybe a few more times will make it 'true'
1458	1	a	Good lesson! Always take the easy way out to try and avoid consequences of actions. Instead of leaving a note on a car saying you accidently hit you...you should just casually drive away. Thanks Simone!
1459	1	a	Really? Can you link to a creationist website that does not connect evolution to people doing bad things?
1460	1	a	And that would make you the one that IS advocating the murder of our future generation.
1461	1	a	No you don't cede that decision to her, Steeeve, you want to butt into her personal life and make her decision for her.
1462	1	a	Ready to condemn blind faith yet, jyoshu? Or are you going to stick to the argument that blind faith is fine so long as you can see you're not doing harm?
1463	1	a	Umm, don't know about you but I also eject waste through my penis - just don't do it when having sex, just not polite (unless they ask, now there's another fetish I don't get). Isn't it odd if the anus was not designed for a penis its still pleasurable?
1464	1	a	Hey don't insult Olberman... he looks good on the tube emoticonXGood lol....
1465	1	a	You're out of your depth here kid. Go and clean your push-bike before you go out on your paper round....it's a disgrace!
1466	1	a	After all he isn't a cousin after all is he. You obviously are older than I thought or spent too much time around the DPC. Old joke? Q. 'where do cousins come from,' A. 'aunt holes'.   Darn J.P. and after all this time we spent together emoticonXHoho
1467	1	a	Dear god.You really haven't a clue about what your talking about.Away with the birdies i think.Yousef was responsible for the 93 bombing,and he himself had very broad associations with some of the Al-Qaeda hardcore(Osama said he didn't know him and was in Sudan while Yousef stayed in Peshewer).Osama wasn't responsible for the 93 bombing,he wasn't responsible for Bali and Madrid and i don't care what the world media tells you.But by all means keep spouting your misinformation,i for one find it hilarious.  The Yousef-Osama-Saddam link is a conspiracy theory.
1468	1	a	And I didn't. Did you note how I explicitly put [Jesus said] for the first two quotes from the Bible, but not for the third one? Any idea why? Come on, think ... you can do it!
1469	1	a	"What, to be ""open-minded?"" or to embrace your definition of ""tolerance?"""
1470	1	a	This coming from someone that is very choosy in the question that they answeremoticonXRolleyes
1471	1	a	So if you are not naive then you must be evil
1472	1	a	Well, I guess this all just proves that more brain dead crack babies are surviving than I originally thought.
1473	1	a	Well, the antichrist is going to come and make any true believer a heretic any way so what am I worried about? I knew the risks before I accept the job. :-)
1474	1	a	What prompted this?  I guess I need to check what website I'm in...  Your response, Orion, (like trs) is that of a gutless, spineless, dip-wad. One who would tinkle in your drawers if you made such a claim while facing me. But, I've dealt with your sorry, trashy kind before and have found that no matter what is said, you'll act like you're ten foot tall and bulletproof.  But, carry on, Orion. You've shown your true colors now. Cluck at will... emoticonXChicken emoticonXRolleyes
1475	1	a	In the future, please try to spare me the theatrical flair.   ....
1476	1	a	Are we talking about the same Obama here? The same one, who's head of the DHS, told law enforcement to be on the lookout for anyone who disagreed with the government?
1477	1	a	Just to let you know you're welcome to come back and debate Islam, don't hurry, you've a lot of reading to catch up on.emoticonXHoho emoticonXLove
1478	1	a	wow....there is a real person under there. Good luck on your recovery, chemist.
1479	1	a	A load of unowhat repeated for many years now. Junk science commissioned to get results that were desired. Check out lung cancer rates for Rastafarians. Nothing abnormally high. Gateway my arse.
1480	1	a	I made contact with God once, but the acid wore off....
1481	1	a	So you are happy that they chopped of the most sensitive part of your penis? That someone took and cut out a part of your body without your consent? What if it where your nipples? After all nipples on men serve no purpose.
1482	1	a	I'm with Smiley: you're describing yourself perfectly, save for referring to conservatives instead of liberals.
1483	1	a	That's deep.  Movement is not matter, I will use that the next time I decide to babble.  Are the particles no longer matter when there moving ?  Your funny.
1484	1	a	Looks like my first response to this was deleted? I'll risk it again since this post was not deleted.  Anyhoo,  This post just wreaks of the emotional and psychological development, maturity, morality, character, and integrity of SOME Republicans/Conservatives. emoticonXRolleyes   Waxy
1485	1	a	Of course it's solely a product of women's behavior simone. It's the women that has to make the phone call to the stork. The stork doesn't answer calls from men.
1486	1	a	I knew the mangling of Jesus's teachings would be forthcoming, and entertaining. emoticonXHoho   And of course lying about what I've said is just par for the course. Standard stuff, nothing to compare with trying to make Jesus out to be pro-cruelty.
1487	1	a	Sounds like someone could be lying... hmmm who could it be? emoticonXIc
1488	1	a	My thoughts are my own, not from some 2000 year old Book that makes as much sense as a bag of Rocks. And I have only ever called anyone a name in response to an attack on me,   If you call what you have been doing debating then I see what the problem really is.
1489	1	a	It might be telling that super heroes typically don't use firearms. That I'd prefer my crowds to have few if any guns concealed within hardly makes me pro-crime. Nor does it make me a pacifist. I'm a big fan of violence. The hands on kind.
1490	1	a	Name them. Real contemporary people who testified about a real superman. And don't forget to identify the time period and where they lived and their written historical accounts.
1491	1	a	Wow. I particularly like the part where you criticize someone for a lack of intelligence while making an elementary grammar mistake. It's you're not your.
1492	1	a	Haaa Haaa Haaa Haaa haaa haaa haaa haaa Thats a good one not. emoticonXClown
1493	1	a	Or possibly your Holy Fathe has resorted to XXXXX-bashing. It's all perspective. Frankly, I don't think that the views on this message board will fuel discrimination and hatred of Popes everywhere around the world, so I think they have less to answer for.
1494	1	a	Again, you speak as if gays and lesbians are not worthy of their relationships being sacred to them. As if gays and lesbians are unable to hold dear any concept of commitment, loyalty, partnership.   What a sad and mean little man you are.
1495	1	a	Pro-lifers are like slave traders? What a pro-lifers trading? Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right is a slave trader...like a right to life...???
1496	1	a	I think that is true of so many things. Wanna screw something up royal? -- add humans.  I heard once that a gallon (or maybe is was a barrel) of Coca Cola (syrup) is more expensive than the same amount of oil. Things that make you go hmmm.

1501	1	a	I'd be happy to be of service in distributing those assets but Alan is probably armed.
1502	1	a	Exactly, because it's not just an issue of 'her body'. What she does (the smoker) affects other people. Thanks for missing the point.
1503	1	a	Shhhh . . . don't tell anyone: Habitat for Humanity is a religious (GASP) organization. Those mean old hateful Christians--helping giving homes to needy people . . .
1504	1	a	Is there some kind of prize for most consecutive straw-man arguments. I ask this because you seem to be going for a record. No where have I claimed that I would fix your problems, many though there are.
1505	1	a	So it's your contention that hundreds of thousands of firearms stolen from residences annually is just par for the course?
1506	1	a	Oh he won't read that... This American in exile (does not even live here anymore) just disappears for a while whe the heat is on only to resurface with his same propaganda after the heat has died down.
1507	1	a	And Creationists who can't tell the difference between cats and nuclear reactors don't understand fluid mechanics.
1508	1	a	So then will you go the way on liberty (repeal stoopid laws) or tyranny (enact more unconstitutional laws)?
1509	1	a	Archie, you have said so many incorrect things about evolution on this thread that it's hard to know where to begin. The idea that 'evolution teaches essentially that a fish walked out of the ocean and survived long enough to become a mammal 'springs readily to mind.
1510	1	a	Waxy:  Why are you standing by saying nothing while one of your own is continuing to show how ignorant he is by asserting Isochron was not used at KBS Tuff ?  Ray M.
1511	1	a	What the freaking hell are you even talking about, dude? Hi its Me did not even post that. Do you even read the dang posts here before spouting off your drivel!? Not to mention that it proved the unintelligence of creationists (as well as their predictive abilities, which, I must say are very poor).
1512	1	a	Crammed with them, sure, why not? It's easy, only a few million light years. The scientific method is used in weather forecasting too.
1513	1	a	Well, it does take some scientific knowledge to understand the evidence for evolution. One doesn't expect Creationists to possess it.
1514	1	a	And because this man said it, it must be true? A simple appeal to authority.
1515	1	a	People make mistakes (excepting some pro-evolutionists who respond with anger and blame others of 'twisting their words'.)
1516	1	a	Oh damn it...and I was going to sell this joke and retire!
1517	1	a	Why should you mutilate your son? Maybe you should have listened
1518	1	a	"Is that your logic? Does the phrase, ""crime of opportunity"" ring a bell?"
1519	1	a	Yawn, again you keep repeating this. You not only refute yourself by providing an example of knowledge of the unknowable, but you gave an example of what is unknowable, by telling me I'd never be able to know you!
1520	1	a	Interesting. It seems that you like to get your news from Aljazeera.

1523	1	a	So, I guess in your view, educating people against prejudice and intolerance is a bad thing.
1524	1	a	Your posts read like gibberish when you fail to complete the thought. Try to be more careful in the future.
1525	1	a	Was she on her knees, taking lessons from you...or was she skilled already?
1526	1	a	You do that, and be sure to use it when I repeatedly and ignorantly claim that the unborn are parasites while refusing to actually prove it as ingus has done here. Unless you too are making that claim also, then I would make the same challenge to you.
1527	1	a	This is a free market of ideas. The good ones survive. The bad one die like dinosaurs.

1537	1	a	So if it was deemed by 'those with the knowledge that give their opinion weight' that a fetus can feel pain and stress during a termination you would agree that the termination should not be carried out..well done
1538	1	a	Just trying to bring some consistency to the debate. You love it when Democrats pander but not when Republicans do it. Why am I not surprised? ;)
1539	1	a	Examined the record? Now it's not even the patient, just the record? Good god man! Many times, only a number of criteria must be met, not all of them. It would be like me saying that there must be gas in your car since it is running. Then you tell me that I must look at the gauge then physically take the tank off to be able to say without a doubt there is gas in it. Flat EEG in the cerebral cortex means no brain activity in cerebral cortex means PVS. There is no reason to test a swallowing reflex, a pain response reflex, or sphincter tone.

1545	1	a	Yes but its like sharks when there is blood in the water. Plus I at least do this for fun and why should I not get in my own ideas and have my fun with creationists. They are getting pretty rare you know. Can't let those other rationalists keep them all to themselves. emoticonXAgree
1546	1	a	Why did the president have to lie. Kerry served, Bu$h just helped himself to the cocaine.
1547	1	a	So, if a baby is having trouble breathing that's been born already, you don't consider it a 'person'? Methinks you've not thought through the implications of your argument here at all.
1548	1	a	Um, of course, it was too much to expect murderers to shell out for burying their victims. I keep forgetting I'm in Dick Cheney's America.

1553	1	a	I avert your gaze. I submit myself to your mercy. Henceforth I shall only respond to your web postings. I shall not respond to postings you make on the web....Wait.....
1554	1	a	LOL. Glad he didn't come across a dung pile while he was fashioning us.
1555	1	a	Well, if you claim you can give 95% of Americans a tax cut then you'd have to be on par with Jesus.
1556	1	a	"The Pastors are claiming themselves as a ""Spiritual shield"" against witchcraft. Of course you don't need such a shield until you find a witch, guess what happens next."
1557	1	a	Not only is everyone in agreement, which scares me enough, but Parcum even agrees with me. This is really shocking!!!! :)
1558	1	a	They're not Jews, and not rabbis, just like you, who are not in your right mind, and who is an authority on nothing but rubbish.
1559	1	a	Yeah, gassing and murdering 6,000,000 Jews doesn't qualify as suffering very much.   emoticonXRolleyes   I wonder how many slaves were killed by comparison........
1560	1	a	So what are you proposing? Death panels? Do you think we should euthanase the elderly or should we simply stop their social security payments and healthcare?
1561	1	a	Unfortunately for you, that is not shown, the evidence points in one direction, and one direction only. That of evolution and to the fact that the flood never happened.
1562	1	a	You're right, why not simply kill these people in the shortest amount of time possible. I got it! We can advertise each killing (hanging, rock slaying, Guillotine, etc.) weeks in advance, kinda like moves, and show it on pay-per-view. You can buy tickets to watch the show live as well. I mean c'mon, if we're going to have the death penalty we might as well utilize in the most gruesome, cost efficient, and swift method possible. Right? That is how punishment was executed a few centuries ago.   Honestly, how you feel is how a lot of people culturally conceive such offenders. In regards to the death penalty debate, it falls along a continuum between morality and scientific reasoning.
1563	1	a	Oh that greatly changes the equation doesn't it? Very unrealistic, but for the sakes of the debate, why not? Well, alledgedly, 23 innocent people have been put to death, and for sure two unrefutable cases. I don't support killing people as a deterrent or as any means in a justice system.
1564	1	a	According to Genesis? Why are you trying to present that as scientific evidence? Should I present The DaVinci Code as scientific evidence? How about Darwin's On the Origin of the Species?
1565	1	a	Insects are not birds. Get your terminology correct. Also please stop lying. It makes baby jesus cry.
1566	1	a	How do you KNOW Bush let's Cheney run the government..oh yeah, that's right, CNN/CBS told you. So you will knock one of the greatest minds this country has because he has a bad heart and can't stand for long periods of time? What a goober, so I guess Stephen Hawking should die too, huh?
1567	1	a	god, this has been argued against a thousand times. by this deffinition masterbation is killing, menstration is involentary manslauter. by this deffinition you kill someone every time you walk by a carrot without eating it.
1568	1	a	Well, I guess you can refuse to see something that's pretty obvious. It's up to you.
1569	1	a	"Yep, but those ""mixed views"" are slanted way left of center. A good offense always beats a good defense :) My guess is you are not very mature nor old? You out of high school yet?"
1570	1	a	French like turkeys even the yanks eat turkeys. What has a turkey got to do with the French voting No! By the way, why do you spell turkey with a capital T?
1571	1	a	I guess we just haven't shaken all of our Imperialist ways. After all, we've only been away from the British Empire for a little over 200 years.:p
1572	1	a	Because their reasoning is obviously on the same level as their reading comprehension level.
1573	1	a	So if you were attacked by a 250 pound man who is an 8th Degree Blackbelt, you'd prefer a fair fight?
1574	1	a	That may seem like a brainstorm to you kronus, but to the enlightened, it was an obvious brainfart. emoticonXGood But I would never expect you to know the difference.
1575	1	a	"NAAAAA, actually it makes ME sound quite sane...I'm not denying a woman the ""right"" to have sex all she wants. THere ARE ways of having sex WITHOUT getting pregnant, I'm sure you'd agree.

In Bizarro world, you might be right, but not in reality"

1578	1	a	The surcharge should go on gasoline from ME oil used by 300+Million Americans daily. But wait! That would unfairly burden the working poor that drive gas-guzzlin' hoopdies, so scrap that idea. Let's just soak the rich for the hell of it..... because we can. emoticonXRolleyes
1579	1	a	It's either that or he's a frustrated tenor for the Vienna Boys Choir. ;)
1580	1	a	Well, if you want to tell the truth, the theory of evolution is NOT a religion, it involves no magical deities, it takes nothing on faith. And since creation involves supernatural forces that are supported by absolutely NO evidence, it is not a scientific theory.
1581	1	a	He was referring to the mimivirus which does NOT act like any other virus. Some of you people need to study a little harder :)
1582	1	a	I don't know about you..but being shot in the back is more human than being taken apart piece by piece. If I recall correctly, Chinese inmates sentenced to death are executed this way to minimize the pain.

1588	1	a	So much bandwidth; so little substance.   Aren't you embarrassed to post such inconsistent ramblings?   Women with pre-existing mental problems are more likely to experience post-abortion issues. Well, DUH!!!
1589	1	a	You mental midgets insult my intelligence when you aren't even aware that the word omnibenevolent isn't even found in the Catholic Online - Catholic Encyclopedia . In fact, the word isn't found in any popular dictionary what so ever. It's an urban slang with no historical usage in theological studies or history at all. I ought to know, because it never came up in Bible College, ever. But here it is in the famous and highly referred to URBAN DICTIONARY: Urban Dictionary: omnibenevolent Once again guys, get a clue before you start spouting off your criticisms which you haven't an actual clue about.
1590	1	a	Tell ya what; I got this Rolex I'm wiling to sell ya for $50.00. Give me the money and wait here. I'll be right back!
1591	1	a	So I pray to chance every night before I go to bed?
1592	1	a	You're living in an absolute naive dream world about this guy. I think I should be trying to sell YOU the beachfront property.
1593	1	a	Better a godly set of morals being crammed down your throats than the perverted gay sex hedonism of the devil himself.
1594	1	a	i take by your redundant posts that you havent read the previous 20..
1595	1	a	Having politicians monitor their ethics is much like having the mafia monitor crime.
1596	1	a	"This is not to say that every current dictionary includes such a definition... yet... but a number of major on-line ones demonstrably do, and to my knowledge human civilization has yet to suffer any negative effects.   (By the way, the above entries also include the typical ""husband and wife"" kind of arrangement as well. Funny how words can have more than one meaning, isn't it?)"
1597	1	a	Just like Obama is? Really? Have you researched it at all?
1598	1	a	"Exactly, they are big on condeming the sins of those other guys. It makes them feel better about themselves. Also, it is always a good idea to have a vitriolic campaign about something that will never change so they will always have an enemy - homos are not going to disappear, abortion will never be made illegal. That's how the religious right recruits folks - get 'em all indignant about the ""others"" and they never notice they are being fleeced by the fat little pastor."
1599	1	a	"I see -- in your opinion is it is ""illegitimate"", therefore it must be so. I think I trust the legal opinions of the courts more, but then, they do occasionally make mistakes. It's just not at all obvious they've made one in this instance."
1600	1	a	"If you'd have taken the time to watch the movie ""Expelled"" you wouldn't find it nearly so absurd. emoticonXAngel"
1601	1	a	Don't worry, think everyone knows that your side doesn't have the sole monopoly on crazy.
1602	1	a	So the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem. What is the reason it's not legally recognized? Because the couple is gay.
1603	1	a	You still trying to push your propaganda film? Let me ask you something, why would the fetus try and avoid the forceps? An infant will cheerfully try and grip a knife that is about to end it's life.
1604	1	a	Actually, it is quite apparent that you do not. For one glaring example, below you incorrectly state that a dinosaur fossil has been dated by C-14. Another example of you lack of understanding of the topic is your failure to understand why very old fossils are found on the surface and the principles of dating from geologic strata.
1605	1	a	So you'd ask on these issues even if you didn't know if they had signed it?
1606	1	a	Don't get your panties in a wad, 38 State Attorney Generals signed a brief in opposition to any gun control this clown can dream up.
1607	1	a	That should get the natives milling around looking for victims. Fundamentalist Christianity does not take kindly to criticism.
1608	1	a	This rates an 8 out of 10 on the hypocracy scale. Weren't you just scolding people both for using false analogies and for citing emotionally laden imagery for political purposes? Tsk tsk.
1609	1	a	who knew? I wonder if I could have passed all those philosophy tests based on the philosophy I absorbed?
1610	1	a	"What exactly are the age ranges of these ""children"" in the news stories?"
1611	1	a	Hey that would be great. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners of military service age and ability to own a fully automatic rifle. The law would FORCE all anti-gunners to train with the weapon. The law would FORCE VOR to keep his rifle clean. Hey VOR how about it? Keep your rifle clean or go to jail. I'm not talking about my rifle, I'll be glad to keep my free government rifle clean. How about you?
1612	1	a	There is the potential for a human that comes out of many, crude and vulgar things. Some end up on a maxi pad or when a guy reaches for the box of Kleenex. Should I feel a special bond with the conceptions rudely flushed out because they couldn't make it to the uterine wall? They had the potential, the DNA, were once a life too, and made a valiant effort. Life is constantly in motion. We don't value all life, or maybe not all life the same. When it appears to have some aspects of human personhood, this would seem like a logical marker, where we'd place greater value.
1613	1	a	And I just spent all that money on a new camera. Pity.
1614	1	a	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO just because I stated that some presidents....cough.... Clinton.......don't get experience in one term doesn't
1615	1	a	That's a Damascene conversion if ever there was one! Archie's seen the light!
1616	1	a	This should be in the science section, not the CvE section. Don't give SS any more reason to believe that the big bang is part of biology.

1618	1	a	oh, it's obvious that non-darwinists have no affect on you guys. Nothing will ever change your mind because your mind is not made up on the evidence...it's made up on your worldview and your belief in materialism.
1619	1	a	So, am I looking for attention or am I mentally ill?
1620	1	a	you told me in an earlier post that the mother should die, even if they predict the fetus will kill the mother. your bible states otherwise.
1621	1	a	When 90 percent of this forum is left wing out of work Liberals it is not a surprise that polls don't go the Conservative way.........
1622	1	a	Since you seem to know Jebus so well why don't you ask him to make an appearance and tell all of us heathens the error of our ways.. Why not let Jebus tell the world what he thinks about Homosexuals ... Oh wait.. Jebus never mentioned the subject so this is just YOU and YOUR ilk spreading more homophobic paranoia ...   You've reached a new Low EZridden.. and I never thought you could get any lower ...emoticonXBounceremoticonXBouncer
1623	1	a	I have never, and will never stand for reasonable gin control laws. After all, I hate vodka martini's.
1624	1	a	Actually, it makes sense only to you. If you look at nature for just a little while, you willl become aware of a great deal of death. But it is mostly very economical since scavengers make sure that there is minimal waste.
1625	1	a	Are you blind, or can't you read? NATO just provided evidence right now.
1626	1	a	You resort to the Bible, just in whatever way is convenient to what you want it to say. Just like fundies do. Zardoz, the problem is that when you play devil's advocate (which you like to do), you ONLY take a fundie approach toward the scriptures. In fact, you're often more fundamentalist in the way you approach scripture than fundamentalists. You'd make a good fundie, the best of them, I suppose.
1627	1	a	So you think that ID is actually Christanity?   [quote]But in usual fashion you will claim it is me who doesn't understand when it is you who must corrupt the truth with the lies and distortions you tell.
1628	1	a	Funny. Foreigners are always cited when liberals talk about how great gun control is and how much good can come from it.

1633	0	a	"So you feel that Mrs Vo should have been allowed to run the risk of dying?      Your statement ""An abortion never has to be done"" only holds true if you place the value of the unborn child over that of the mother in all cases. Do you really believe that?"
1634	0	a	Really? I suspect that you have been duped by creationist ministers. There is no hype about Miller/Urey. It was an interesting experiment that demonstrated possibilities.
1635	0	a	Actually, I don't have any respect for creationism in most of it's varied forms. I have had great respect for several individual creationists that I have met. But they earned that respect.

1637	0	a	I don't know if we can be as accurate as a couple of million years, but I agree that the age of the earth is just right for supporting man.
1638	0	a	uh, yeah, that was their intent! Under color of law no less. The truth always seems to be your worst enemy doesn't it?
1639	0	a	And if God was so against killing the unborn, why did he fail to make an exception for the pregnant women? If you alleged that the Biblical God is totally against killing the unborn, why did he tell him to kill all of the non-virgin women?I bet you won't answer the question and just rely on insults as an attempt to cover up your argumentative failures as you always do. See my signature for examples.
1640	0	a	It has a chance. Any scientist has the opportunity to study ID. We are discussing the science classroom. We already teach it as a hypothesis in most schools. But it simply should not be taught as a valid alternative to evolution. That's what this debate is over.
1641	0	a	Actually, I've heard it all before and it is wrong. The article is full of misinformation and misrepresentation. It is, as you say, slanted rather than an honest report of the data.
1642	0	a	No, but in some cultures they mutilate them for meaningless tradition.
1643	0	a	No, genesis is not a history lesson. It is a combination of 'just so' stories, and a religious message in allegory format. If you bothered to learn understand some of the hebrew puns behind many of the words, and also see the political commentary of events that were happening during the time it was written, that would be obvious.
1644	0	a	Not at all, more stories that have been fed to you. The notion of a literal Genesis was rejected two hundred years ago, when no evidence of it could be found. the leading scientists of the day were often also trained in divinity, so they were looking HARD for it. But they had the integrity to admit that it wasn't there.

1646	0	a	"Your use of the word ""replace"" reveals your ignorance of evolution."
1647	0	a	One reason for conversion is that they do practice many religions. Jesus said He is the only way to God. I believe that, so how can I just turn a blind eye when people follow so many different religions? I would not be following the commands of my Lord.
1648	0	a	And how have I deprived you of your right to teach your religion to your children in your home and in your church. How does an objection against the imposition of your religion by force of the government deprive you of your rights. I can certainly see how the imposition of your religion would deprive me of my right to the free exercise of my own religion, but why do you feel that you have a right to impose your religion on me?
1649	0	a	Except that the word for day in Genesis 1 is 'yom' and was understood to be a twenty-four hour day.
1650	0	a	The human collective is the authority. One major advantage of this authority over a theistic one is that it actually exists.
1651	0	a	That's the standard dance. Victor Stenger didn't say it that way. On the back of his book, one review puts it this way;
1652	0	a	Ah, but the issue in this thread is what the fetus really means to anti-choicers/anti-lifers.
1653	0	a	No I'm not Kronus. I haven't made excuses for him or denied what he did. OP said he is a conservative Christian which is a lie and I'm exposing that lie for what it is. Unless she can prove he is anything more than a conservative secular Republican, then he is no more a morally responsible person than an atheistic democrat. To attempt to mark all fundamental christians with the actions of this guy because he's a republican is a truly fallacious argument and a slanderous lie regarding me and all believers. None of this excuses what Vitter himself is responsible for doing. But she is wrong for immorally attempting to paint us all as adulterers because of his sin.
1654	0	a	"Actually, this data point is perfectly meaningless.NONE of the other information (or the conclusions) presented in this talk require ""26"".If we made it 260, does it change ANY of the other conclusions? No.A failure to recognize non-sequitur data tidbits is usually indicative of an argument that includes other errors."
1655	0	a	"Very true, especially since when someone asks ""is there a God"" they are most likely really asking ""does the God in which I believe exist"""
1656	0	a	Marriage is not a religious institution. It is a government contract nothing more. Many people choose to have a religious ceremony to celebrate their marriage but that doesnt make it a religious institution. Need proof? You can get married without the permission of the church but you cant get married without the permission of the government. And because marriage is a government institution then they cannot discriminate against same sex couples and must provide the same benefits to them as is provided to straight couples. And it cannot be a separate institution either because separate is not equal.   But as I have already said this shouldnt be up for a vote. Civil rights never should be.

Or was not even one of the millions of believers who prayed for Terri Schiavo's life to be saved really God's child? Gee, I wonder how many people out there are being led by a pastor, priest, or what have you, that prayed but God didn't listen because that religious leader is a fraud? Hmmm, maybe the rape or molestation of young boys, adulty, and so on, by religious leaders is more widespread than anyone could have imagined?!?!?!
1661	0	a	Again, nonrandom is not the same as Lamarckian. Phenotypic variation can be nonrandom because the organisms can select the most attractive/successful mates with whom to breed. Once again, you're totally stuck on one aspect of the ToE, random mutation; the ToE is much more than that.
1662	0	a	But recognition of the big bang as a very good explanation of cosmology isn't limited to evolutionsits. In fact, most other scientists also believe so, most especially cosmologists and astrophysicists, who are directly concerned with the early universe. Evolutionists, even though the origin of matter and time are irrelevant to the study of evolution, are also educated in science and probably accept the work done by these other scientists.
1663	0	a	Because it's a blatantly obvious fact of nature and intellectually honest experts in the field accept it.

1670	0	a	There is a point, however, that the fetal lung is not mature enough to survive outside the womb even with mechanical assistance. So, unless our technology will be pretty radically different in the future, it isn't about getting it out, it's about it not surviving when it is out.
1671	0	a	lets see im going to ask you some questions.are you ?are you a ? do you have blue eyes? do you have brown eyes? now if you say NO to one of those things isnt that cosidered an answer? where i come from its yes or no.2 possible answers. not just yes every time to get what you want.
1672	0	a	"Right. It was thrown out of schools back in the 1960s, and again in the 1980s when attempts were made to dress creationism up in the jargon of science and call it ""Creation science."""
1673	0	a	Which, we suppose, in your mind releases the sperm donor of any responsibility whatsoever, right?Isn't it interesting that your solution for the abortion issue demands that women deny their sexuality while permitting men to run the gamut of theirs.Does this attitude, of which you are not the only proponent, stem from a hatred or a fear of women?
1674	0	a	"Well, let's be honest here. People fear gay marriage, not that it might come about via judicial fiat. That's just the current whipping horse because that's how it happened first, for some broad values of judicial fiat of course. There was a recent post here about rights granted gays by their state legislature, Oregon I think, and a group jumped in and forced the law on hold via a petition drive. So it really isn't the means by which gays get equality that upsets some folks, it's the equality itself. ""judicial fiat"" is just a phrase people can use so they can avoid stating their true motives, preventing gays from being treated as equals."
1675	0	a	"Indeed. And that fact makes the old creationist plum about how evolutionary theory is dogmatic or that evolutionary biologists aren't allowed to disagree with ""standard"" theory a laugh. Clearly, evolutionary biologists disagree and those disagreements are published openly. Science makes progress by questioning and disagreement."

The Violence Policy Center also pushed the idea of an ""assault weapons ban"" because it was easier than a handgun ban, claiming that the uneducated people are unable to tell what is a machine gun and what isn't a machine gun, making passage of such a law all the easier."
1677	0	a	Yes, T. Kennedy is the alias of a known terrorist, and Ted Kennedy got punished because of it. And many are advocating that such a system be used to deny Second Amendment rights and be used to try innocent people in a court of law.
1678	0	a	If a square is opposite to a circle (and it isn't, by the way), then gas/liquid/solid must be opposites therefore you contain opposites (by your own argument), in that you contain elements that are in these 'opposite' states. It's an argument I raised before, you said they weren't opposites, now you cite non-opposites! Why do you keep refuting previous arguments they YOU have made?

1682	0	a	But the number of criminals that have firearms can be reduced. In developed nations that have very strict gun laws there are a lot less criminals obtaining and using guns to commit crimes. How does your theory explain that?
1683	0	a	I never said anything about a conspiracy Peeling. I very clearly gave valid reasons to Consider that scientific GRANTS and pay increases for these scientists are based on making new and previously undiscovered claims that forward the science. That is the greatest motivation to lie, cheat, create and falsify evidence which adds to the scientists personal wealth and further promotes a false science that is rife with selfish motivations to preserve, protect and promote it.
1684	0	a	'IF' is the question. It suggests that Holy Tradition does not know the answer.   Secondly, the issue of the flood itself could still be true and tested scientifically... as to whether an historical Noah existed that you might consign to 'myth'.   Does anyone here not find it interesting that there is almost a universal factor in societies concerning a global flood?   PS I have already discussed M-Eve on another post.

I think thatthe terms used are 'Vacuum flucuations', and 'virtual particles'. I am not awareof any peer reviewed articles on it , but a popular press book is 'Achilles in the quantum world' by Richard Morris.

As wrong as that may seem to you, it is the reality.If we, as a society, would just address the issue of unwanted pregnancies, then we, as a society, will resolve the isse of abortion.
1688	0	a	No. you're not making any sense. Where is symbiote? I got a horrible argument for him to dispell.
1689	0	a	Why so many claims in opposition? I make a single claim, that can be refuted through logic, if it's fallacy. But the claim is correct.This new claim is an interesting one that I have seen others use. I'll tell you on what basis. Based on reason. To hold that nothing can be known for certain, is ultimately reduced to absurd unintelligble nonsense. I'll start a thread about this claim, it's a hot topic to be sure!

1694	0	a	Those cultures that permit multiple wives at least do have issues as a result, but hard to say they fail miserably. We are complex animals and not all animals mate for life. There is significantly more involved in the lifelong union of humans than reproduction. Multi-marry under the right circumstances works, but it isn't for everybody and even for those that it is for doesn't mean it's for them always. In a nutshell marriage is the biggest commitment any person will make and should be given the consideration and thought it deserves. Same sex marriage can cause a perfect union of two people the same as M/F and can make a mockery or marriage just as many M/F unions currently do. The emotional investment is the same, the responsibility and obligations are the same, the only difference is genitalia and a little more hair in some cases.
1695	0	a	I see what she was saying now. When she said it it sounded like the man had no opinion at all.
1696	0	a	No kidding. What could POSSIBLY be more concrete? As far as I can tell, she has never publicly made a statement specifically about the DC gun ban but since, as you pointed out, she DID say that no functioning democracy should allow private ownership of guns, I have trouble believing that she thinks the private citizens of DC should be allowed to own guns, UNLESS what she is saying is that since we own guns, we should move toward a monarchy or perhapse some kind of dictatorship. She did not, as far as I know, voice her opinion regarding private gun ownership in a totalitarian system.

1700	0	a	Actually, the process of fossilisation is not slow and can be done relatively quickly. All what you need is for sediments to quickly cover a dead (or an alive body - as what would have happened to Noah's Flood) and hence, fossilsation can occur rapidly; evolutionarly speaking, fossils take millions of years to fossilise a bone, but unless the bone is covered by sediments quickly, the bone will never fossilise.

There's no rebels in America killing entire cities worth of people without opposition; not even in the small towns that're without a local police force.   Explain that one away.

1713	0	a	This isn't discrimination because the adult once did have have the right to live in a womb until it could live otherwise. Once out of the womb and living on his/her own this right has been exhausted because there is no need to be living in the womb. Much like you can drive but this 'right' is exhausted when you are drunk or too old to see anything.

I think Big Orn is correct 7 to 10% is probably a bit low."

1722	0	a	I think you might want to check your logic here... As far as I am aware, drug addicts cause a great deal of crime to support their habit. As you are, I am not terribly fond of policing someone's personal habits, but when drugs are the motivating force behind burglaries, assaults and muggings and addicts carry diseases such AIDS and tuberculosis then means of curtailing this should be explored. This may include policing or controlling the supply of drugs to an area to cut down and the amount of drugs sold, and thus less crime to support fewer habits.Easy access to drugs is, logically, part of the problem.
1723	0	a	And how would Bush look if his own people hated him so much that they revolted? That would be very bad publicity, and quite an embarrassment that I wouldn't want as a country leader.
1724	0	a	The logic we use to make statements about reality is derived from the way we observe material things behaving, and that logic is not immutable. Quantum physics demonstrates the fundamentally uncertain nature of reality at very tiny scales: the 'law of excluded middle' in particular taking it firmly in the shorts. Given that logic can vary on such a simple metric as physical scale, your argument is starting to look more than a bit frayed at the edges :)
1725	0	a	"So,in your opinion,are you saying that this invading force that you are talking about,would never bat an eye as to whether the people of the USA are armed to the teeth or not in their pre-war planning?Surely any country that tried to overtake the USA would suffer severe damage to its military in all aspects.And even if it succeeded,it would still have to deal with our armed citizens.Are you trying to tell me that this is not a ditterent?Sure,if you dream up some DARTH VADER size invasion,no one stands a chance.But if you put it real world perspective.Say,2 or 3 of the bigger countries got together and decided to over take the USA.I would assume ""armed citizens"" would be a major factor in deciding whether to invade or not."

1727	0	a	So was I. I did say I was playing devil's advocate. As far as I'm concerned, Tiktaalik is a triumph of scientific deduction.
1728	0	a	"No. Unless you wish to actually undertake the study of the relevant science, that's what you need to do. Creationists do the same thing. the problem is that creationists tend to accept the word of those who aren't any more educated than they are. Thus, a creationist will accept Hovind's dust on the moon argument or his shrinking sun argument as ""proof"" of a young earth."
1729	0	a	As I mentioned above, science curriculums follow paths. One's worldview plays heavily on one's interpretation of scientific data. An agnostic, or atheist teaching establishment can become satisfied with one path of scientific theories without searching for others. There may be more to be discovered about thermodynamics, cell structure, irreducible complexity, the decay rate of the earth's magnetic field, radiometric dating, the fossil record, and countless other things that a teaching establishment may not be interested in exploring, if it's comfortable with it's interpretation of current data's indications that the happenstance origins worldview is correct. It goes back to what we touched on before - teaching students HOW to think, not WHAT to think.

1734	0	a	Sure. The outcome of Heller vs DC and Florida Shall - Issue laws support that statement. According to Brady logic, the more helpless you are, the safer you are from criminals.
1735	0	a	Actually, at 24 weeks is when the the interconnection of the fetal brain begins. The nerve cells from the neocortex begin to synapse with the nerve cells of the thalamus. It is at this point that bursts of recognizable brain waves start to appear among the random signals that go on before. It is at this point that some scientists believe a fetus can feel pain as well.It is also at this point that a fetus can possibly survive outside of the womb (23-24 weeks), though the cance of survival is low and the risk of impairment very serious. This point probably won't change with technology either because the fetal lung is not mature enough until this point for even mechanical-assisted breathing.
1736	0	a	And yet there are plenty of websites written by scientists with the details:
1737	0	a	What is a 'higher' species. If you mean a more intelligent primate?? The concept there is a hierarchy of 'higher' and 'lower' species is incorrect. Theonly difference between man and the other primates is that man has a hyperdeveloped brain. There are two sugars that are naturally produced by body by most mammals. When investingating the presnece of these chemicals, one of them is present in much lower concentrations in the brainsof all mammals. However, humans have a mutation that interrupted the production of this chemical. A piece of random junk got inserted into the middle of the gene that produces this chemical,and disabled it. Sometimes,evolution is not so much about what is added, but what is removed.
1738	0	a	maybe firstly you should explain how god works? In what way does he manupilate matter in defience of the laws of physics, where does he dwell, how can we not observe such a being? And all the other questions of the supernatural. The theory of a god is actually a lot, lot more complicated than evolution as you have to explain *how* God works to get even basic science points.
1739	0	a	Throw off our conclusions about what? I'm getting a bit confused as to what you're trying to cast doubt upon.Dark matter is stuff that doesn't interact via the electromagnetic force, so again by definition anything that we can't 'see' using EM waves is dark matter. this is an interesting article about one way we can observe it indirectly
1740	0	a	"I see the similarity with the original scripture, in which Jesus was recognizing the authority of both God and Caesar in the world. However, Jesus was talking about the political power in the world. Jesus called the academics of his day, vipers and hypocrits, because they pretended to be holy but were evil. He called the wisest of men fools, because they did not believe in God. Also, as I stated before, truth should be the ultimate goal. I do not fear science. I do not see any truth that science may happen to reveal as a threat to faith. Why? Because God is Truth. Jesus said, ""And the truth shall set you free""!!!"

1745	0	a	Sure, but then you get into all sorts of problems of classifications, slippery slopes, and other awkward messes. Arguing whether an embryo or a fetus is a person seems to raise more trouble than it might solve. It seems better to err on the side of caution and devise a pro-choice argument that assumes the embryo or fetus to be a person rather than worry whether they are a person.
1746	0	a	This is a separate issue, Voice of Reason. Some didn't understand how pro-choice people can say they personally wouldn't do something and/or think something is wrong but still support other's right to do it, and that's what I was answering.

1748	0	a	I think there are two separate questions here.(1) When does personhood begin?(2) Who gets to make such arbitrary, moral decisions on behalf of a pregnant woman?Both are legitimate issues of contention. You can't just dismiss the one you don't want to argue as unimportant. There are lots of excellent arguments going every which way, and many of them are objectively unresolvable, such as the one pertaining to the onset of personhood. They are truly matters of opinion.So, since there is obviously little agreement between people about when an egg and sperm become a person with full human rights, the practical question really is whose opinion matters most? The woman's, or the faceless bureaucrat's? emoticonXGood
1749	0	a	Kent Hovind is a slimy, uneducated, hack. His only education past high school is a degree from an unaccredited bible school. He is also a liar, since I just can't believe that anyone could be so stupid to say some of the things that he does. Of course, there are other people that are so stupid that they actually believe him.
1750	0	a	And if you rewind a little over 40 years, the exact same thing could be said about interracial marriage.Archie's reply is a non-argument, and false at that.Multiple other groups state discrimination in marriage, but there are LEGITIMATE STATE INTERESTS prohibiting their marriage.Little things like child rape, lack of consent, and other issues.

1753	0	a	Because their axiom is that the bible is infallible, so any problems with reading it are the reader's fault, whereas yours is that contradiction implies error. What Ken's saying is that we can't draw a distinction between your axioms and those of a bible literalist in terms of which is 'right', because axioms are stated not proved: axioms define what is 'right'.To reiterate: his error is in forgetting that the universe operates according to its own axioms, whatever they may be, and we can judge whether or not our axioms are congruent.
1754	0	a	But you haven't looked. You may claim that your god did it, and no evidence to support or deny that can be offered. The assertion relies on miracle and has no suporting evidence. But when you start talking about how your god did it, your claims can be debunked by facts. Certainly the mythology of ancient nomadic herdsmen is not accurate. If you look at the world and the history of the world the is evident in the geologic strata, then you can see that the earth is very old, and you can see a succession of organisms through time. When considered with other fields of science from genetics to biogeography to physiology and anatomy, evolution becomes apparent.

And while it is true that everyone has bias, using correct science and the process of peer review works to eliminate. Not all is perfect, and people are people, but overall the system works. Not a lot of bad science gets through. In the case of ""creation science"" we know that there is no science involved. Only talk that sounds scientific. There is no hypothesis, prediction or testing. Only ad hoc stories constructed of selected bits of evidence to support the foregone conclusion."

The theory of evolution, and the theory of intelligent design would equally observe, measure, and publish the effects of the apple falling.

Students shouldn't have it implied to them that happenstance origins are the only possible cause of gravitational behavior. Your ""apple falling"" scenario is a simple one - the original cause of gravity has practically no impact on how we observe and deal with it's effects. Other scientific subjects aren't that simple."

1765	0	a	The concept that science no longer looks at animals boggles my mind. My brother is a wildlife biology major in college meaning his primary focus is......looking at animals and their relationships to one another. It is somewhat understandable that your misconception could arise because molecular biology and genetic engineering are the latest crazes in science. The simple fact is most of the big breakthroughs when studying whole animals have been made. A similar turn has occured in chemistry. I could argue that chemists have subtly turned away from chemical reactions. All the research now is about electron orbitals and nano-structures. The reason for this is these are new fields that are relatively young and many scientists are interested in them. I myself am doing research on buckminster fullerenes. It doesn't mean we've abandoned good old fashioned reactions, we just have more field to play in now.

1770	0	a	Really Brady. It is widely recognized that Mr. Heston gave away a very promising film career in order to take such an unpopular stand at that time. In fact he worked very little in films after that. I think the above statement was a political one, an anti-gun one, without much fact to back it up.I don't think a man of such principle changes his mind when all he actually work to accomplish comes to pass. But you can push your poison just as far as you want to. You have a first Amendment right to do so. Mr. Heston would have wanted it that way!
1771	0	a	"Actually, there is no such thing as ""an evolutionary mutation of a gene."" A mutation is a mutation. For evolution to have occurred requires neither that a mutation be new nor useful and they don't require new structures nor structures.Here's a little mental exercise for you. At most, a person can have only two alleles for any gene. This would have been the condition of the human race 6,000 years ago according to creationists. It would not have been possible for there to be more than 2 alleles for any given gene. Now consider that for every gene in the human genome there is an average of 14 different alleles, sometimes more, sometimes less. Where did all of those alleles come from?"

1778	0	a	But a slightly larger brain than average is still feasible and offers enough of a benefit in a large social group that its worth the price - however something the size of a modern humans brain is far too demanding. That slightly larger brain can be supported by an organism or society that hasn't developed fire, but is also able to discover the uses of it, from then on nutrician isn't the big limiting factor that restricts how big a brain can get from then on.
1779	0	a	Well regulated as in the second amendment does not mean regulated by the government, it means well equiped and prepared. The framers of the constitution often spoke of a tyrannical government and how to keep one from coming to power, so why in the hell would they have said lets just give the government total control of guns. Your definition of well regulated makes about as much sense as adding another day to the week.

At conception we are a person and human.All living things belong to a species and the foetus is a living thing, for that reason a foetus must belong to a species, and that species is human.A fingernail is dead so cannot be considered a living human, nor will it develop into a human.The sperm only has half the chromosomes so is not human.The unique human is the key element here, if you cut your nail, the DNA from the nail can be replicated by the living persons nail, a foetus when destroyed cannot have itself replicated, the unique DNA that is destroyed will never be see on earth again, that individual has gone forever, howver, the man with the nail clipped is still alive.
1786	0	a	True, they can change laws if the are unconstitutional. So what makes a ban on abortion unconstitutional?   Also, what makes the dealth penalty for minors constitutional one day and not the next? In fact 15yrs ago it wasn't an unconstitutional decision. I guess now it is??? Makes no sense.   Clive14,   those are obviously not my beliefs as I think everyone is equal.   I am not sure your wealth makes you different from someone else. It means you wealth is unequal..we are talking about just people. We all end up 6 foot under (so to speak) in the end.
1787	0	a	I think this is a bad way to put it...the evidence that they earth has been warming since we have had the ability to measure temperature is overwhelming...the cause is unknown and whether or not it is natural is unknown.

1793	0	a	Because self-defence, unlike most other 'reasons', automatically allows all citizens firearm access, and in most cases allows firearm acess without mandatory training/evaluation. When this occurs, you are much more likely to get misuse of firearms.If you read around you'll see that I consider all rights as needing justification. This comes both from my stance as a relativist and as a UK citizen, where there is no formalised Constitution. Ask yourself this - if a right cannot be justified, why should it be treated as a 'right'?

1806	0	a	well yes that's what he did, but he did not try to present this as positive evidence for anything. the biomorphs were used to illustrate the point that random mutations are much more likely to produce beneficial results when the mutations are small. analogies always break down at some level, this analogy was used to illustrate a certain point. the assertion that dawkins was suggesting that a biomorph happening to look like a real life object were proof that evolution and natural selection could produce such creatures is false. montalban, to restore integrity i suggest you retract the conclusion you drew from snippets and quotes from dawkins as your paraphrasing was clearly not representative of dawkins' ideas.

If you travel to a state that does not offer civil unions, then your union is not valid there.I think there's a problem with dissolving those unions as well.The big difference, though, are the rights that these unions provide. There are over 1,000 legal protections and rights that marriage provides that civil unions don't. I'll try and find a list of differences.

1816	0	a	So you're saying that the theory of evolution is similar to ####, in that they both make large messes when they come into contact with fans?
1817	0	a	Yes, because its THEIR decision, its THEIR stomachs, and its THEIR lives. I agree that some decisions do need to be made with parental consent, but not this one.   Irrelevant. How does purchasing a house have to do with abortion?   Ok, so what if the kid wants to have the baby and the adults want to get rid of it? What if the adults want her to have the baby and the kid wants to get rid of it? You would force the kid to have a child (that doesn't seem responsible at all), or you would force the kid to abort her child (thereby taking away her son or daughter). Both of those decisions don't sound very consitent or responsible. The decision is best left up to the person that is pregnant, regardless of their age.

1827	0	a	"Yes. It's not logical to simply cite, ""the Bible tells me so, the Bible was written by God,"" and consider that an argument. The Bible has been wrong. It's also not logical to cite authority to God. It necessarily begs further questions about your God's unproven existence to those who don't believe in that God, or in any God. If we don't simply believe in your God, on the basis of your presupposition, he can have no authority over the rest of us. One must come up with another argument.Should each religion have it's own definition or completely different idea of logic, which favours that religion and its God?"
1828	0	a	"""He"" is real to all of us fjp, whether we acknowledge Him or not, God is alive and well on Planet Earth. And the day comes for each man when he faces that reality. For some of us it's a long awaited day of joy and for others a long dreaded day. But believe me when I tell you that just because one denies that God exists, it does nothing to lessen His reality."
1829	0	a	No it doesn't. First, the changes may not be neutral. I will presume that you are intelligent enough to grasp that idea the mutations in and of themselves are neither advantagous nor disadvantageous, and the they have no purpose. Evolution happens when the mutations (and other mechanisms that increase genetic diversity) are acted upon by other mechanisms of evolution. Even in natural selection there is no purpose. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Some organisms tend to produce more offspring because they have characteristics that give them an advantage in a particular environment.

1834	0	a	Actually the details of HOW embryogenesis proceeds is becoming increasingly understood. And it goes way the heck beyond speculation. Check out how homeobox genes work and how regulation by master switches is understood as just two examples.
1835	0	a	Why would that even be expected? When you consider that it is important to maintain some sort of consistency in study populations, obvious mutants are excluded from the breeding stock. And yet, there are frequent observed mutations. In fact, my elder son once observed two mutations in a single fly in one of his populations. One fly had no wings and white eyes.
1836	0	a	I'm not arguing that gun control will change the nature of men- though guns may make them more willing and confident to engage in crime. With guns criminals can do even more damage. Adding guns to crime is like adding gasoline to a fire- it makes an already existing problem worse. If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.

1838	0	a	I do not argue so much the quality of llife of an individual woman but more for the quality of life, indeed of having access to life itself, of the children of the woman involved, because in many situations the concern and nurturance of a mother may be the only thing keeping children alive, especially in poor, war-torn nations that do not enjoy the relative wealth of the United States.
1839	0	a	Interesting, but it appears to ignore the fact that there is pre-existing variation (just look at the pictures). Emphasizing mutations is ok, but relying solely on them will probably skew results.

They would have advised him precisely how to store them and he wouldn't have had any issues at all. Here's the FAA Regs for traveling what is and isn't allowed.

1842	0	a	I think some people will and have argued that. I'll work on finding a quote, but I believe it was somebody here who argued that, because of the recent SCotUS ruling, home invasion in DC would decrease because criminals would be more worried about encountering a homeowner with a gun. You do have a point about preventing a worse crime from occuring,though.

1866	0	a	They can if they're Catholics since Evolution is accepted doctrine now in the Church.
1867	0	a	Well, this gets rather complicated. A very young child does not get to choose his or her adoptive parents. Who decides on who adopts whom depends on the kind of adoption and the policies of the particular adoption system. In private domestic adoption, the birth mother usually gets to decide on who will adopt her baby. The foster care system is organized differently, and international adoption is different still and depends on the country from which the child is being adopted. So it's pretty much impossible to generalize about adoption policies and practices. They vary greatly.The point is that the purpose of adoption is to protect the rights of the child.

1879	0	a	Would you mind telling us just how he determined ALL maladaptive or inconsequential mutations in his test organism and just how he validated such measurements? To me as a biologist with quite a bit of microbiology under the belt it would seem to be impossible to do so! After all its very likely that a fairly large portion of the populutaion will have at least one mutation at at least one base pair location in the total sequence! Your claim would seem to be impossible, but perhaps there is a way he managed to do so.
1880	0	a	here we go Dan. your problem with the law is not whether its fair or not, its whether you can benefit personally from it. you have no problem with abortion because your not going to be the victim of such a law, but youd definitely have a problem if you were the one suffering from the law. Apparently you dont care if the law disadvantages or is unfair to others, as long as it doesn't hurt you, you're OK with it.
1881	0	a	So? The point was that people who support gun control are not necessarily communists.
1882	0	a	I see. Then you are attempting to define evolution out of existance. By your definition (not that of evolutionary biologists) evolution requires an increase in information. An unsupported creationist argument. Define information in a meaningful way. Please apply your definition to genetics and show why all genetic changes are a decrease in information.
1883	0	a	Very well said. However, we also believe that gun owners should get as much training as possible, necessary, desired etc. It just should not be required to participate in a Right Recognized by your Constitution as Inalienable, and therefore protected. That sets a bad precedence for the rest of our Bill of Rights. However, safe handling of any potentially dangerous tool is just common sense.
1884	0	a	Exactly. That the change in moth color was due to natural selection was first posed in about 1896 by J.W. Tutt. The funny thing is that as pollution increased, the moths turned black, and then as the pollution was cleaned up, they turned white again. carbonaria have become pretty scarce.

1900	0	a	And the point was, Benjamin, that it is dishonest to cite the work of others, with no indication that it is the work of others. If you take what someone else wrote, they you need to indicate that, telling where you got it. If it is a book, then the author, title, publisher, date and page. If it is a web page, then the URL should be given.Even better, express your own point and tell how reference supports it. Tell why it is important and why it shows your opponent wrong - then just give a link. Generally AIG is really bad science and isn't very interesting. It is misleading, intentionally. However, on these boards are familiar with their stuff.

What inheritance should a good man leave to his children's children? Solomon wasn't talking of money, but of God's law. In Solomon's view, the wicked can have their money, the true reward goes to the righteous. Why this should contrast with selling your luxuries and giving to the poor I'm not sure.

They site many studies on the issue, which I have not taken the time to look up, as I think this sort of statistic is worthless.

There is no clear cut fossils showing the evolution of man, is there. By ""true human"" I mean they were just like us, just varients of human kind that we have today - looked human, walked like us, most likely were quite intelligent.

1931	0	a	So you still choose to believe that someone who's a victim of crime should be punished as if they committed the crime themselves?
1932	0	a	Actually, this (if what that article is true, which I am not quite sure) is a healthy part of science. Old theories are disgarded and new ones come in as more evidence is brought to bare. Every theory made by fallible man is prone to being disproven and destroyed. Man's theories change everyday, while God's word has remained the same.
1933	0	a	But it is based on history. There is plenty of history showing that women had illegal abortions. Or, if their families had money. went to Costa Rica or Britain to have a legal one in those countries.Women died or had severe medical emergencies due to illegal abortions. Doctors and nurses were prosecuted for providing these services.

However, if the pregnancy is desired then the changes are welcomed by the woman.To a woman who does not want to be pregnant then those changes are very unwelcome and are a bad thing. Pregnancy is always harmful, but the perception of what is happening changes depending on the woman.You do not understand that whether or not pregnancy harms the woman's body is objective, but whether or not the woman wants the pregnancy anyway depends on the woman. You are mixing the two.
1937	0	a	**Here you reveal exactly what I've just spoken of--you assume that science and the scientific method equates to, is synonymous with, materialism/mechanism. It most certainly is not. Nor is the accompanying assumption, i.e., that any science which does not strictly adhere to materialust/mechanist assumptions, is not, and cannot be, real science. Equally untrue.Both assertions are unnecessary to an objective approach to science, per se, but are part and parcel of an emotional defence of materialism/mechanism and its biological aspect, RMNS darwinism.

1940	0	a	Like the above quote, why is the church trying to stop abortion when they would consider one to be alive after taking a breath. if you were to look at it from a scientific standpoint, the individual ovum and sperm are living cells, but they die all the time and no one cares. An embryo or fetus is something starting to develop into a human and that can't be stopped without killing it or injecting differnt DNA, but it's still not too different from sperm and ovum.If you can't trust the church to make fair decisions and follow values and morals and rules they put in place, how can you expect an honest good decision about anything from it.
1941	0	a	The terrorists saw it as absolutly necessary. Personally, I disagree. When we kill children in Iraq, we see it as absolutly necessary, call it a horrible side effect of war. I disagree on that, too, I don't think it is necessary at all.

No, and the same is true for people who smoke pot. Oh, sure they may also do other things once and a while, but it wasn't simply because they tried that first joint. It's just a personality trait and a common one. If pot didn't exist, these people would be doing something else. The same with alcohol and cigarettes. If they didn't exist, people would find some other type of vice."

You just made another gaps argument making the assumption that if theory X does not explain observation Y that a theory which is untested and untestable MUST be the only alternative explanation. Balderdash and shame on you. The alternative theories would likely be numerous and the ONLY one is not something untested and untestable.But I forgive you GOD probably made you make the error for his own mysterious reasons.

I suggest you surf youtube for a bit. Rememeber however, that kids are more emotionally unstable than adults. Hormones and guns aren't a good combination.   I agree that's silly.

1953	0	a	You haven't proven anything. All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say. You must corrupt what I say since you can't accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument.
1954	0	a	A being is something that is conceivable as existing...or something that actually exists.A human being is one of us, a homo-sapien, a member of the group of beings known as animals.A rock is a being of inanimate qualities.God is the supreme being, not capable of being understood totally as this would put Him (or It, or She) on the same level as those that He created.We will never be able to define exactly what or who God is!God is great.God is good.Let us thank Him for our food.God is my shepherd.God is my Light.God is my Co-pilot.God is what keeps me from believing that all this (the totality of all things and happenings) came about by accident.When God made man, She was only kidding! ;)

1957	0	a	Well, the question I am asking is for you to provide a valid scientific prediction based on creationism.
1958	0	a	Creationism is not something new, it was the prevailing view of scientists up until Darwin. None of them belived in a divine parrot that is just plain silly. In the crucible of natural science throughout the Middle Ages, the Scientific Revolution and well into the 19th century theology was the queen of the sciences. Now we subject students to higher math studies that they will most likely never use and speculations about conceptual mechanisms like natural selection that have no practical application. Naturalistic presumption has become sacrosanct in the rhetoric of the professional scientists who have been crystal clear on how they define creationism. You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology.
1959	0	a	At what cost? How many civil rights are you willing to give up in the name of a few less murders each year?

How much do you favor a nationwide curfew where violators can be arrested by the police and held without legal counsel for an indefinite period of time? Do you favor the use of physical and mental torture to force convictions even from the innocent?

And if there is someone ""up there"" who will damn you to eternal torment if you don't do what he wants (which is one interpretation of the Bible) than that might effect the way you act. I realize that that isn't exactly the same as changing your moral compass, but history has demonstrated that most people's moral will stretch to accomodate pressing needs, and I think an actual vengeful diety would qualify."
1961	0	a	"So for example if I say ""you are a part of my body, and therefore I have a right to kill you"", is this simply a matter of ideology?I admit the distinction is not clearcut at early stages of development, but how do you support the idea that post-birth children are ""a part"" of their mothers' bodies and therefore legitimate to kill?It is no more legitimate to say that a fetus is a part of a woman's body than it is to say that a woman is a part of a fetus' body. Just as a woman is not a subordinate slave to the fetus within her, the fetus cannot be considered subordinate in rights to the woman it is inside."

Anyway, atheistic evolution says that there is no intelligence, the scientists who were trying to repeat what may have happened have intelligence and they made many such measurements to try and create life from lifeless chemicals - in other words, the experiment was already logically flawed!

However, they have no evidence, so they have a long way to go to be shown to be worthwhile to pursue. Even a simple application of Occam's razor tells us that to suspect a thousand theories on how life has changed on earth is unecessary when another theory can fulfill the description entirely, of life, and they have evidence to support it. It's why this theory is discarded onto the heap of any number of theories that simply isn't going anywhere. You can make up a theory right now about how life began, but if it cannot be supported by evidence or is redundant to a theory already described...why would we?

Why not post just a summary of your position so far, as you see it - I can do the same, then you can continue with your argument?   There's no point in writing an argument, summarising it and then leaving the thread before I've had a chance to respond to even your argument (never mind your summary). If you are going to simply ignore any criticisms of your reasoning, then I struggle to see the point of you repeatedly requesting a one-on-one debate in the first place - you essentially regress your argument to the 'because I said so' that you are (presumably) hoping to avoid, it's just that there's slightly more detail.

That is a ludicrous and totally bogus argument to make.If you thought rationally, you would have it in the health forum and be complaining about how third world countries are so ill prepared for this common problem when we have the technology so readily available to avoid it. My Lord simone, a simple C-Section is all that is required to make this a non issue for mother and baby. But you ignorantly post this drivel as if abortion is the solution. It makes no sense at all, and yet you post it thinking that you're contributing something rational. Go figure, huh!!! emoticonXFrazzled

That zygote may have more potential for the future but the decision is being made in the present. I would feel far more guilt in sentencing a real person to die than in sentencing a potential person (now merely a cell) to die.

We know that a similar mutation occucrred in other moths North America some years after the 1848 record of the B. betualria.There are actually several alleles of the gene responsible for color that form a dominence hierarchy with the fully black morph (called carbonaria) as the top dominant and the typical as recessive. The intermediate forms are referred to as insularia. They are uncommon. At any rate, by 1895, 98% of observed B. betularia in industrialized areas were carbonaria.

In other words, you would have to be God in order to judge God. Now, the point I made is that this is highly unlikely, as any being claiming to be God would not misspell words, no matter how closely the letters are on the keyboard.To be clear, I was not attacking you (at least I didn't intend to) by calling out your spelling mistake. I was trying to illustrate a point. And the point was this: you are not perfect, and therefore, you are not God. And if you are not God, then you really cannot stand in moral judgment of God.

Some states have provisions for allowing people to vote on local laws, but in some states the government is allowed to prevent the vote.

If the Bible says something different, then either God meant Genesis for peoples past and now uses scientists to explain things better (though I am uncomfortable with this idea as many scientists are atheists), or our puny minds, compared with God's, haven't yet worked out how Genesis and an old Earth tie together.

They made the bill of rights and constitution so that it would limit the government (to keep it from becoming too powerful, and overstepping it's bounds). And the only way the constitution could actually be enforced was for the population to uphold it.Back in the time of it's writing they probably saw the best way for a population to force a government to not over step it's bounds was to force it... er... by force.Today in the information age, a much better weapon is our right to vote.

It must have been the impetus for the rise in popularity of abortion.A human embryo does have features that look like gill slits. They are not gills but pharyngeal clefts. No modern book presents any information that human embryros have gill slits as if it is fact.
2103	0	a	Well let me put it like this, I consider it your duty because if you don't protect yourself then you basically shift that responsibility to someone else. Not only is this incredibly selfish, but 9 out of 10 times the 'protection business' gets outsourced to the State.This in itself it dangerous because when people decide that a third party like the State (which has no real accountability) has control over their lives it can all to easily lead to a situation where the State becomes tyrannical.More people have been killed by their own government than by any foreign government.
2104	0	a	Hang on....think about it.......if there is a large group of people who live in the south, and this large group of people moved to the north, WHY -- being from the south -- would there be anyone in the population that had light skin? Look at Iraq -- all those people have the same exact skin color. Same with Kenya. Same with Japan. Same with Russia. Thus, if any of those groups of people were to migrate, they'd all be in the same boat! There would be NO measurable variation of skin color. Your premise is faulty -- as is the whole premise of Toe.

2108	0	a	Apart from the 'horizontally instead of vertically' part which I didn't understand - we're a hundred or so years too late, unfortunately. You might as well ask for an example of a book or website on cosmology that 'admits' the sun may just be a big ball of fire pushed by a scarab beetle, and not a nuclear furnace about which the earth orbits. There comes a point where continuing to seriously 'consider' a viewpoint becomes a waste of time and resources, because sufficient testing has been done and evidence recovered to discount it. We may one day encounter evidence that completely overturns the whole applecart, but so far it hasn't happened.
2109	0	a	"The quality of life ethic is far different from sactity/dignity of life ethic. A quality of life ethic carried out to its logical conclusions does not promote a pro-life society. Instead, there would be genocide against the handicapped, elderly, and people who people of power have deemed life unworthy of life. The problem with this ethic is that it is centered in arbritrary people deciding arbritarily which person passes the ""quality of life"" test."

You have obviously never seen whart drug abuse does to families and people's lives. You're right, alcohol is worse, and the main reason its worse is because of 2 reasons, volume and availability ala social acceptance. Legalizing all drugs would have catastrophic social impacts.Don't feed me that line about taxing it and using the money for rehab. We have taxed the XXXX out of tobacco and alcohol the last 100 years and the last time I checked alcoholism and lung cancer hadn't been erradicated.

2124	0	a	"Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological."

Biology works because every individual cell doing what it was created to do along with what the one next to it was, though created to perform another set of instructions creates the molecular change that the combination of the cells together would produce. But there is no additional information there... not int he way you assert.

2131	0	a	That's EXACTLY the point. Regardless of whether or not human minds think differently, whichever mind produced and agrees that 2+2=4 is absolutely correct, the rest are wrong. We know this because we can observe and test the concept in the physical world and prove that it is true. This goes for just about anything, dissention in the face of facts does not change the facts.IMHO, this invalidates your claim that something produced in the human mind is not absolute due to some human minds being contradictory.
2132	0	a	Well then maybe you can prove it somehow. California has all these laws you support, and even more than that. So if they have these laws on the books and have had them for a while now, and if they're effective at fighting crime, then you must surely have evidence of some sort to prove your case.

2152	0	a	Not by any means. Evolution works on genetic change that future generations will inherit. Adaptation does no such thing. It changes an individual, but not its genes.For example, if my parents volunteered to be part of a scientific experiment where they two additional arms fused onto their body before I was ever conceived, I would not be born with two extra arms.On the other hand, if a genetic mutation made it advantageous to have two additional arms, and both my parents had that mutation, I would be born with both arms.

The Darwin quote is a particularly craven quote mine: he was expressing empathy with those of his readers who found it difficult to imagine how such a thing as an eye could evolve by stages; effectively putting himself in their place so that he might more readily take them by the hand and show them how such evolution may occur, with ample supporting evidence from the natural world. I refer you to the Quote Mine Project for further edification.

However, when the flaw results in putting innocent people to death, it is not worth the risk.In 26 years the death penalty has been in effect in my home state of Illinois, there have been more people exonerated due to irrefutable evidence than have been put to death.

2162	0	a	I think often abortion is wrong but I do not agree with criminalizing it. Primarily the reasons that are used to justify criminilzation are hugely fallacious and secondarily because it won't do a thing that is positive. A woman who is determined to end her pregancy - will. Criminalization will simply make it extremely dangerous. I am responsible, have even had my tubes tied, but if I were to become pregnant and that pregnancy were the result of rape or a threat to my health or livlihood I would end it - and I will not be checking the law books first. Every woman has her line in the sand - abortion will go on regardless of its legal standing. There are a miriad of reasons seek abortion - comdemning those reasons does nothing (i.e. calling them selfish) - addressing them could help. The reasons are valid.

Each group goes through different selections and they accumulate small changes. Eventually, they will be different enough so that they are no longer able to interbreed. That doesn't mean one group automatically has to die so we remain at the same number of species.Of course, one group might get some significant advantage which allows it to come back and ownzor the original area so the other group gets wiped out.

2170	0	a	No, I think you're trying to do more than that. You're trying to say that the increase in crime is due to a lack of gun ownership, aren't you? Because if you are, the article you cite doesn't back up that claim.   What, no actual data to back up any of your claims? Do you have access to US crime numbers? How many armed breakins do you get in a country where people do have guns? That's the comparison that needs to be made here.
2171	0	a	It depends on your intention and your methods. Of course, things that don't have some sort of physical manifestation that can be measured can't be studied by science.

2173	0	a	Archie is NOT right - he has an opinion, as we all do. Pro-lifers seem to want the definition of human with attendant rights to begin at conception. The blastocyst is now turning into a tumour. So the pro-lifers can now alter their views on what constitutes 'human' as and when it suits their purpose.Forget the emotive view of what an embryo/foetus looks like: some think that as long as it has appendages and looks human, then it IS. It isn't. It's still a parasitic organism dependant on the host mother. You can't deny that.Contraception v. abortion is a separate issue: in the meantime, the host mother should be the final arbiter of what happens to her body.

That's all.

It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be ""with"" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves ""not with"" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be ""with"" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist."

2187	0	a	I suspect that you are thinking of birds. But early birds had fingered claws on those wings. It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal.
2188	0	a	The tactics pro-lifers use make the Nazis look like the little league. I mean, seriously. The reason we are dealing with terrorism is because women have the right to the abortion procedure. Wow. Please give me one way those two things relate to each other.

2192	0	a	Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring.....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier. I'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism. Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?

What you're speaking of is no different than this.The way I see it Brady, your hatred for guns and gun owners is so overwhelming and logic defying, that you'd be perfectly alright with unleashing a life-ending pandemic plague on the people of earth if you believed it would put an end to all gun owners everywhere.

2211	0	a	Your claim is not supported in the least. If we look to the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, we find that it was not women seeking abortions that were punished, but the people who procured the abortion that were. It would be the same if abortion were again made illegal. To prove this, we need only to look at a recent abortion regulatory statute: the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. Needless to say, there are far less doctors who perform abortions than there are women who seek them, and because it was not a problem executing abortion law prior to 1973, it likewise won't be a problem executing abortion law should abortion be made illegal again.

Pro-gun activists give lip service to the idea of enforcing the law and catching the bad guys while supporting legislation that actually makes it harder for law enforcement to do so. They send a mixed message. It's happened before such as when the NRA has lobbied Congress to reduce the budget of the ATF. How can reducing the budget of law enforcement help them do their job better? It gives us a clue to what the gun lobby's true motives are. Truly disturbing.

Your typical athiest, though, looks within to find what's moral or ethical and it usually just stems from what's acceptable behavior within the human species. This is also where religion gets its morality and ethics. But times change, and eating shellfish won't kill you, and eating meat on friday won't make the farmers go broke, so the morals and ethics change to fit the society.

Both men made observations of slow gradual speciation in the fossil record in a small geographical area. These changes were reflected at other locations as an abrupt change from one species to another. But given that such changes take place very quickly in populations that are usually under environmental stress and isolated from the main population, and given the rarity of fossilization in the first place, we don't expect to find many examples in the fossil record. It is a bit like trying to time a 100 yd. dash with a sundial. The fossil record just isn't fine grained enough to see the rapid (50-60 thousand years) changes.
2272	0	a	The VAST majority of abortions are performed within the first trimester. When they are performed in the second trimester it's a serious procedure for the mother to go through, and is something she obviously wouldn't go into lightly. Her reasons for choosing an abortion as late as that would have to far outweigh anything else, and she would need consent from two doctors to go ahead with it. Basically what I'm trying to say is something like the foetus being developed enough to feel pain would not change the mind of a woman who had just found out she was pregnant and she'd been raped, or was going through something you can't understand. For an abortion that late she'd have to deliver the foetus anyway, which is traumatising enough.

That's not compatible with young earth creationism. Geology finds an old earth, wich isn't compatible with the mythologies of sacred writings. But that is not to say that one cannot be a qualified scientist and a deist or a theist. There are lots of good Christian scientists who accept evolution.

So these arguments I get from the likes of you and Iangb which argue that until a child shows mental awareness, it isn't actually a person deserving of human rights is a bogus and shortsighted position according to the scriptural point of view. Of that, there is no question.

2306	0	a	You bring up a very interesting point.   All those state level marriage amendments which were voted on also made civil unions illegal as well. When polled, residents in those areas were actually unaware that the amendments also outlawed civil unions.   So, not only are the anti's disingenuous as far as what they promoted, but were so in HOW these amendments were promoted.

2308	0	a	Well yes, but thats not what DEFECTIVE GULO indicates. If one has external sources of vitamin C, GULO can mutate to be inactive without causing a problem, and once inactive the inactive gene can be inherited without causing problems so long as vitamin C intake is high enough. An inactive GULO indicates that the species has external sources of vitamin C which is essential to many metabolic processes.

However, there might be another problems which are also big threat to us and all creatures on the earth.Anyway, I'm not an expert of environment, so I might be wrong but at least I can say it seems there are some bad effetcts of global warming such as rising sea level, abnormal climate pattern, things like that.We should do something, which might not be appropriate way to solve the problem but it's surely the beginning.
2312	0	a	Well, the slavery analogy for gay rights is past it's applicability at this point--one was a property issue (also rooted in deep prejudice), the other is a morality issue. Many people oppose gay marriage out of morality and NOT prejudice. The same can't be said for slavery. There are many ways that the analogy doesn't work and that's just one of them. In fact, it could as easily be an analogy to reverse it and say that the ones who did the enslaving were analogous to gay rights lobbyists and the abolitionists were analogous to those who seek to protect marriage. After all, the plantation owners were the ones really fighting for ill-conceived rights--rights that they shouldn't have had.

We've learned to do a lot of things as a result. One of the most important reasons scientists accept the theory is that it works.

It seems to me your argument boils down to ""polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it."" Yeah--such is the price for marriage equality.Let's face it--if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships, they could pull it off--polygamy, gays, letting 17 year olds marry, etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed.

2324	0	a	I think the only valid reason for owning a gun is because you want to. Every person (with some exceptions) has the right to keep and bear arms, why you do it is your own business. Giving specific reasons for gun ownership is the top of a slippery slope towards banning certain firearms.   While I have specific reasons for owning specific guns, to include hunting, I own some of my guns for no other reason than they are fun to shoot.   A humorus side note: I own one gun strictly for fishing, sounds odd but its common practice (at least in Alaska) to shoot large Halibut before bringing them aboard.

2334	0	a	But it took a lot longer to develop. My point was that only after about 5000 years of human civilization did empiricism as science develop. Religion, supernaturalism, and mythology trace back into prehistory. What we know as science didn't even begin to exist until the late 1500s and 1600s. Before that it was OK to do science like Aristotle did - no experiment, only thinking about a logical answer. Thus, heavy objects fell faster than light ones and any fool could tell that the sun orbited the earth.But science is more than an inner way of thinking. It is a process and a method for learning about the universe. It is called methodological naturalism. That is not to say the science asserts that nothing exists except what is natural. It says that science can't study the supernatural.

A perfect judiciary system would not sentence innocent people, and would alleviate all problems with the death penalty. If we had a perfect system and no innocent person was ever sent to death row, we could take them directy from sentencing to a little room beside the courtroom containing a bed and a few drugs, put an IV in them, and carry out the sentence before the jurors got out of the courthouse. Of course, we know that our judiciary system is an imperfect thing, so we understand the need for appeals.

2363	0	a	Actually, if you look at the example I've given, that's false. The probability of A in one organism may be low, but the probability of A in some organism approaches 100% as the population and the number of generations gets larger. And if A is useful and comes to dominate the population, then the probability of an AB individual appearing then also tends towards 100%. In the example above, the chance of an AB mutant occurring, if A and B are substantially useful mutations, is almost a dead certainty. It would be amazing if they didn't stack. So saying that AB occurring is less likely than A is misleading at best, downright wrong at worst. Behe is clearly misapplying probability theory.

For you, one axiom is the existence of Vitality; volition made quantifiable, and the other is that darwinian evolution must be wrong and worthless in every respect.There is no logical reason for you to deride NS the way you do; it's an integral part of any evolutionary theory that seeks to explain the big picture of how the organisms we see around us came to be; the occurrence of mutations, volitional or otherwise is not enough on its own.

Reason beinbg portablity ( irealize you think that some day we might have that, but we don't so far and we cannot ccontrol other countries who may have gay marriage but not cilvil unions and may not recognize civil unions but recognize marriage.)If it is good for straight couples, it should be equally good for all couples. . No one is more superior. Everyone should be equal. Marriage for all is equals.

There is no evidence of any interim species of apes and humans. Not one shred. Those items in the fossil record that are claimed as possibles are only possibles, are dubious at best, and are extremely rare. A recent study also showed that most characteristics of supposed alternate species of hominids were well within the variation seen in current homo sapiens. The point I was making is that if they existed we would see them.

2416	0	a	I think that you missed the point of the argument. VT is arguing that the low birth rate in the West is attributable to high abortion rates and the high birth rates amongst Arabs creates a numbers game in favor of the Arabs. Since they respect life (their own, that is) more than the West, their numbers are growing much quicker, while our lack of respect for human life is causing the gap to widen.

Otherwise, if you never act on those doubts, you are simply being hypocritical.

It also has characteristics that exist in birds and only birds. Some characteristics exist in both. The furcula, for example. A furcula has been identified in some theropods, but it is rather rare and then only imprefectly preserved. An indication that it may be mostly connective tissue. Archaeopteryx has a furcula. But even at that it doesn't compare to the same structure in birds. It is intermediate. Imagine that!"

In fact, for instance, science estaimtes of moon dust have been proven wildly wrong, and those corrections actually harm creation.

2473	0	a	Actually, the answer might depend more on the nature of the question, or the particular religious cult of the person being asked, etc. In questions of science, fundamentalists will tell you that the answer was revealed to them by their god in their holy scripture.On the other hand, you are characterizing religion as insanity. I think that you really mean that when religion is offered as science, then that is insane.
2474	0	a	Well . . . one could make that argument about anything--voting for instance. Amendments are created by voting, and people and legislatures vote (hopefully) their conscience (and the will of their constituents), even if they are religious. I think this is a different matter than, say, displaying religious icons on courtroom walls or grounds, which is a clear endorsement of religion by the government. The 18th amendment was religion-motivated, but it didn't get rescinded for THAT reason. It got rescinded because it didn't work practically.

The last 10 - 20 years as we have become more us vs. them the overall prosperity and well being of the country has declined. With both sides taking the country to extremes. Conservatives eased restrictions and corporations run wild. Those laws are in place for a reason. Liberals overreact and put a choke hold on growth.

2550	0	a	The gene and therefore the enzyme it produces. LPL is the designation for a gene that encodes Lipoprotein Lipase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes lipids in lipoproteins. The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.

As to it being contradictory - well the law is loaded with contradictions if you look at all closely. On the other hand consider that the driver killed the woman AND obviously damaged her fetus beyond recovery - WITHOUT the consent of the woman. In other words the death of the fetus was not by consent of the person who holds the right to decide but rather by the negligence or intent of the guilty party.And yes prior to her death (assumming all other requirements were met) she could have AT HER CHOICE and UN-COERCED have chosen to abort the fetus without incurring a legal penalty.

Pro-choice people have to make it as available as possible to counter pro-life attempts to shut it down entirely.If pro-life people didn't exist, then the reasonable people could work towards making abortion rare.Take the current debates for example. My entire point is that it should not be illegal. That abortion should be available as a safe and legal choice (it can only be really safe if it's legal). We spend all our time and effort debating the legality that we spend no time on creating programs to help women choose to continue their pregnancies instead of having an abortion, legal or not.

Fittness is not a reference to big and strong. It makes it too easy to misrepresent evolutionary theory.I'll state it again since you seem to have missed or ignored it the first time. Natural selection is differential reproductive success. Those organisms that are well adapted to their environment tend to survive to reproduce in greater numbers, and therefore they tend to leave more offspring, than those organisms that are less well adapted.You've got to be a pretty shallow thinker to equate an environmental advantage with big and strong.

I do not believe that the original post asked for an absolute answer, just a survey of opinions. After all, as you say, abortion is not math and there is no one answer that everyone might agree with.

Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources ""until the newborn dies"" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty."

Perhaps if we told Freeofthought that the current rate of slowing of the earth is 0.005 sec/year/year. I have no doubt that Freeofthought will misunderstand that number - it is a rate. Just assume that rate has been unchanging even though it hasn't been.A lot of the creationists misunderstanding comes from remarks like the following.

Because the female of the species will be programmed to search for that and will carry the gene herself so will give it to her off spring. And the male will be more succesfull so produce more off spring. So no instant eyes or anything like that. I think that's what you were implying. Sorry for responding in Kronus's stead.

2648	0	a	End the guessing right now. Don't guess. The meaning of the 2nd Amendment is explained in two documents: 1) The Militia Act of 1792 and 2) Federalist Papers #29. Both of which was written by the same Congress and same men who wrote the 2nd Amendment, the Constitution, and established the political philosophy of our country.First the Militia Act states WE AREA ALL IN THE MILITIA and that all citizens bring thier own weapons. - http://www.constitution.org/mil/mil_act_1792.htmThe more broader philosophy and intent of the 2nd Amendment and the Militia Act is further explained in the Federalist #29. - http://federalistpapers.com/federalist29.htmlThese documents are the thoughts and intent of the men who wrote the 2nd Amendment. So gun control slime are guessing or trying to reinvent history when they think gun ownership is collective. None of these documents anywhere support the collective idea.
2649	0	a	You asked where the line should be drawn in regards to weapons?How about where ownership and use of weapons does not violate the rights of others. Before you respons think about it. Do anything you want. If I don't violate anyone then what is the beef? If I don't break any laws or endanger anyone what is the beef?The safe storage and handling of cannon, cannon propellant, and cannon ammo is well known. They can be stored in places typical of homes without violating the rights of others. BTW a cannon is not a weapon. It is considered a 'firework' by the ATF. Ever see a civil war renactment? Lots of cannons? So yes having a cannon in your front yard does fly.

The indian citizens were never actually disarmed under British rule, just the army. During WWI, indians were allowed to volunteer for the British army (the British knew it was a bad idea to conscript men from colonies).

Any one who has voted yes to place these amendments into state constitutions because they have a religious belief that excludes gay people from marriage has also imposed those religious beliefs upon gay people.

Of course evolutionists will come back and claim ""erosion"" with no evidence of such, not to mention how rock can be removed from bone after millions of years of being cemented to it.I've got a 900-page book called ""Hidden Archeology"" (Cremo) that dives into hundreds of fossils and artifacts that are in the ""wrong"" strata. Your assertion is blatantly false."

2720	0	a	Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work. And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.

2728	0	a	Because the men who wrote it mixed their mythology in with their heros. The first 11 chapters of Genesis are obviously mythology. And if what you say is true, then I guess that means that the Illiad is historical. Why would Homer be right about some lives and events, but wrong about others? And of course, there are other parts of the Bible that are pure fiction - Jonah and Job for example.

2731	0	a	Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A. This is what Behe deals with in his book. One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state.   IMO there should be possible to make some sort of calculation regarding the probability of RM being cause of the changes.

The words may change but the meaning doesn't. Math is not opinion. It is not my opinion that a triangle has three angles. That is a matter of definition.Apparently Habbit doesn't understand that substituting the words of another language does not change the concept. That sort of argument is basically ignorant XXXX.

For example, brane theory offers an alternative theory to explain the evolution of the universe.But claiming that the ""evolution of the universe"" is part of the theory of evolution is somewhat like claiming that because Kate Hudson has achieved stardom, she is producing vast amounts of energy through hydrogen fusion. Why is it that creationists believe that every word has only a single meaning?By the way, I have always heard the creationist invention ""GTE"" referred to as the General Theory of Evolution - you know, as if there is some relation to the general theory of relativity."

While evolution does select for useful traits and against harmful traits, that doesn't mean that a trait won't develop that is simply odd. As long as it isn't particularly negative there's no reason to assume it will go away, and so sometimes you get traits that aren't ""useful"", they're simply not harmful.

The tracks were originally discovered immdiately after an unusually severe storm in the area in which an unusual amount of water came down the Paluxy. That unusual flow of water washed away the soil that covered some of the tracks. Other tracks have been intentionally uncovered. For example, in one case, where a trackway went under a bank, several feet of the bank was removed to expose more tracks.

2835	0	a	I think they have more of a chance becasue, while many manage to delude themselves into believing that an unborn child is not a baby, it would be much more difficult to convince yourself that a crying baby isn't a baby. Even in the animal kingdom (which we are all part of) you see some animals hesitate to kill the young of their own species. Evne coyotes will not generally kill a pup (I have even seen a pack of coyoptes pass a domestic pup without killing it, though they could have. I am told this is because of the stubby nose, which shows the coyotes that it is, indeed, a puppy, even though it looks unfamiliar to them).

Could we possibly just accept that we got here somehow, and just move on?
2839	0	a	This statement is wrong. People from hundreds of years before Jesus was born prophesied that a baby would be born, in Bethlehem, of a virgin. There were over 50 more prophesies that were made about his life, and the sacrafice he made to pay for the sins of man, and the bigest one of all...He completely fufilled scripture when he rose from the dead. These men were inspired by Jesus, God, how can you argue that he is not the christ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible. And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God. PM me if you like.
2840	0	a	(My evidence does not require this quote, it's for comparison only)The theory of evolution is based on evidence, the existence of god, is not..Reason cannot be applied to it. Furthermore, since evolution relies on reason, faith cannot be applied to it. To attempt to label science as a faith is a contradiction. I know it irks you that your faith cannot be proven, but that's the definition of faith!! It wouldn't be faith without it. As Montalban says in a contradiction of motives: His particular faith does not rest on the foundations of [reason]. Why then look for support from reason?

Lester, declared that computer programs can accumulate up to 30% 'random change', just like DNA (hypothetically) can, therefore, the computer analogy is a good one. But programmer R. David Pogge declares that even a single altered bit in a line of computer code a million bits in length would destroy it.
2846	0	a	Because the Iliad and Odyssey do not claim to be divine does not mean they should be placed under a different threshold as the Bible. Otherwise, it's special pleading on your part, and thus logically fallacious. This is one of many inconsistencies between skeptics in regards to the scrutiny of the Bible. They are unwilling to put the standards they have on the Bible against other books similar in age. If they did, there would not be a single book left standing.

2849	0	a	Actually, it's not conjecture. The genetic makeup of the several subspecies of arctic foxes bear it out. The dominant allele is rare because it is less adaptive. The dominant allele is most likely ancestral. But even foxes below the Arctic circle show differences in their fur between summer and winter. So yes, foxes that were able to change color in the north had a differential reproductive advantage over those who couldn't.

2852	0	a	Hey, as Collin said, P.Z. registered, and got it. I would say that booting him out is the height of hypocrisy. It confirms to be that it is based on a lie, and the producer knows it. The movie was making a claim that the 'opposition' was silencing I.D., and the presentation of alternate ideas. Yet, what do they do? They kicked someone out they INTERVIEWED for the movie (based on false pretenses to be sure, but they did pay him for appearing in the movie).That sounds that THEY are the ones trying to suppress opposing ideas, not science. Yes, they had the legal right. But, boy did it put egg on their face, considering everything. It shows them to be hypocrites and liars.
2853	0	a	Straw man. I am not attacking the achievements of science. I am attacking the notion that you have that scientists are exempt from the catalogue of influences that affect everyone else; with only the slightest admission of a tiny possibility of cultural influence - which was quickly dismissed anyway with the false analogy of comparing evolution to aeronautical engineering.

It's not politically afraid to pursue facts about newly discovered complexities of life which pose problems for those trying to make a case for happenstance origins. It invites thought, not suppression, of irreducible complexity, another problem for happenstance origins.
2856	0	a	That's because these questions were never, ever, EVER raised in the original Parker case. None of the six DC people who took the city to court possessed a felony record, they didn't bring up anything other than the fact that DC made it impossible for them to legally buy and own a handgun. That's all the court addressed. If they addressed anything else in the Heller case it would've been judicial activism, legislating from the bench.
2857	0	a	I don't agree with this debate. If preventing the Devil from interfering on earth should not be prevented by God then why is it that God did prevent the Devil from interfering in heaven after he was defeated? They are both essentially taking the Devil away from an area where he could potentially harm those that are good. God seemingly saw fit for one to occur but not the other. Why would that be?

Natural selection is the differential reproductive success of organisms with more favorable suites of characteristics. It is a statistical tendency. Individual organisms may work to survive, but they also work to reproduce. That's as close as it gets to ""purpose."" And as you know, Darwin's favored term was natural selection. He never used the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" without also making a reference to natural selection. The opposite is not the case. Since Darwin's time ""survival of the fittest"" has been rejected by evolutionary biologists because it is such a poor representation of the extent of the theory."

2873	0	a	Well said. Most Americans favor more gun control, but unfortunately this majority of Americans tends not to vote based on the issue of gun control while a very vocal minority composed of gun activists definitely does vote based on the issue. This is something politicians have realized since 1994 so they have been more hesitant to support gun control. There probably will be more gun control supporters in office in the coming years but I'm not sure how much this will change things.

By gun control standards she's guilty of a straw purchase and should've been sentenced to ten years without parole in a federal prison.
2882	0	a	But the point is why are there relatively few creationists. The reason is that the creationist position cannot be defended in open debate. That is why creationist boards censor opposing views. On boards where creationists are not protected there are few.

2888	0	a	Well, yes. Eleven years is quite swift, but it actually supports the theory of evolution through natural selection. The estimates of the speed of evolution that you seem to be depending on were done by George Gaylord Simpson way back in the 1940s or 1950s. Since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid. Besides the studies that Reznick did on guppies, there are also the studies of the Galapagos finches by the grants, and studies of anole lizards in the Bahamas. These are observable phenotypical changes, not speciation events.
2889	0	a	No, I mean evolution, in which statistically random variation is but one factor. It's a terrible mistake to equate evolution with pure chance.

2893	0	a	Yes I do understand this. But you must admit that the instantaneous formation of a living organism, even an extremely primitive one, complete with the complexity of the DNA code as a result of random encounters of atoms and molecules is a little too much to buy. There is evidence right there for creationism. Only intelligence could have formed such an elaborate complex system for the structure of life and its propagation.

And the debate in Italy of singles who live together seeking marriage benefits also is a good example of the can of worms that will be opened if society concedes to the gay crusaders the undue rights they are demanding.Why is it absolutely impossible for you to reply to an issue without first redefining it to fit your warped World view?

2900	0	a	Umm...thats the point of saying God of the Gaps - when science fills in the gaps then there is less for your God to do.
2901	0	a	Because natural selection works on a cost/benefit basis.

There is no record of anyone ever seeing a carbonaria before 1848. It is probably a safe assumption that an occasional mutation caused some to be born from time to time, but they were not able to reproduce to the extent that they were ever noted before 1848.

This is the same court that said that only guns in common use are protected by the Second Amendment. That tells me the Supreme Court doesn't think the right to bear arms is as fundamental as other rights protected by the Bill of Rights. The protection of a newspaper by freedom of the press does not depend on the newspaper being in common use.

2924	0	a	Well, I have heard people on the pro-gun side say that most defensive gun uses don't involve firing even one round. So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this? When semi-automatic rifles were banned in Australia, hunters welcomed the law. They saw it as a challenge because it takes greater skill to shoot an animal with a bolt action rifle. Not so in America where some gun owners like to use guns that could take down planes to shoot small animals.

2938	0	a	But there is evidence that we do evolve. I'll give you an example. In areas of west Africa where malaria is endemic there is an allele of hemoglobin that confers resistance when heterozygous. In other environments that allele is not beneficial and is, in fact, deleterious. It is fatal when homozygous. Now according to evolutionary theory such an allele should decline where it offers no benefit. Studies show that this allele is less frequent by about 2 percentage points in Americans of west African ancestry.

Where as Jito supporting a womans right to choose does not impose upon your life in any way.You want to stop me from being able to marry this does not effect your life in any way yet has a devastationg effect on my life. The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it. Therefore you are imposing your religious and moral views on me when I do not share those beliefs.

I think it is good to have this way as a back up while people argue over the use of cells that would otherwise be disposed, and get some treatment to people who need it rather than letting it be denied to them by anti-abortionists. And yeah, it's pretty much guaranteed that someone will find something to object about, claiming it is immoral (maybe it will now be that these stem cells are potential human life and we can't use them emoticonXRolleyes ), but it will likely not have as many objections.

That even goes so far that there are some organisms that get their energy from geothermal sources - no light involved."

Evolution is therefore more deserving of being called fact than gravity is.

2994	0	a	No. That's not what I said. I said that natural selection is differential reproductive success. I said that those organisms that possessed advantageous characteristics would tend to reach reproductive age more frequently and therefore they will tend to produce more offspring, while those with disadvantageous characteristics will tend to produce fewer offspring. As a result, the heritable characteristics of the population will change over time.

3001	0	a	Well then this doesn't answer my question.If you have 10 doctors for 100 people (this is just an example) and only 50 of them have health insurance and each doctor gets paid $100 a year then your health care per capita is $10 ([10doctors x $100]/100 people). If you change it to 100 people with health insurance you now have $10 per capita as well because you population did not change. Health care costs are shown per capita and not per person insured: Per Capita Health Expenditures by Country, 2007 &mdash; Infoplease.comSo again, if you go from $6,000 per capita per that website given above to say Switzerland levels at $4,100 per capita then where did that money come from?

The only thing a glean out of this is that the common people have more sense than the lawmakers. But I've actually known that for a long time.
3003	0	a	Well memory is NOT something that is immaterial is it. Its always implemented in the form of material processes well known to biochemistry. Metabolism, ion flows, neuron activity and interconnections, along with potentiation of those connections into networks.Free-will of course is what we call the experience of our choices being not wholly determined by external states alone. By no means does that exclude the fact that our internal states (of which we are largely ignorant) also play a role. The autonomy arises from the operation of the brain and those internal states. Again a purely materialist explanation. And there is no evidence of anything other than material processes in the experience of free-will. In other words neither memory nor free-will require a non-materialist viewpoint.

3006	0	a	There is just one thing however. The coelacanths found are different from those in the fossil record. Further, ALL evidence pointed to them being extinct, until we found other evidence, and we changed it. And, to top it off, the article says NEARLY extinct, not COMPLETELY. Although, this article was of course written after the coelocanths were re-discovered. Of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with the theory of evolution, which explains the mechanisms responsible for the change of allele frequencies in populations over time.

As an aside it is also a fundemental tenent in Judaism's view of the unborn- the foetus is a potential life, but has not yet attained that state of being, which occurs at birth.

3048	0	a	A law baning same-sex marriage, then I'd agree. But the reason same-sex marriage doesn't exist (other than Mass.) is not because of law; after all, there are plenty of states that don't have same-sex marriage with no law that outlaws it. You're barking up the wrong tree--this is a cultural issue more than a legal one.
3049	0	a	Well, actually society has said that 18 is the dividing line. It can then also say, that under certain circumstances, for a particularly bad person, in some cases it will be considered if the person is 16 or 17. That's why we have all the judges and lawyers, etc...

Interestingly, scholars who made similar claims in the past got lumped in with those who supported a collective right by the pro gun crowd. But I suppose it sounds good to say that all nine Supreme Court justices supported an individual rights interpretation.
3051	0	a	And the risk to minority's civil rights is, of course, the reason for the bill. They are, after all, limiting what can be started via initiative, not eliminating the initiative process altogether. The fraud was merely an example of why the change is needed. As has been argued here before, if civil rights need protecting, it's from the majority. Allowing civil rights to be modified via the initiative process simply makes it too easy for the majority to impose it's will on the minority. That's not what a Democracy is about, at least not our Democracy.

3053	0	a	Actually, I am of the opinion that the fetus has no natural rights of its own. Any rights we grant to a person as a citizen or national are granted at the moment of birth. By granting equal rights to a 3week old fetus that you do to a 20 year old man, you are endangering the rights of the woman who carries that child. Yes, I believe that in most circumstances, the child should be carried to term, but there are exceptions to every rule, and I'm not quite ready to forsake the lives and health of women to protect unborn children. Yes, I think the unborn child is worthy of protection, but not any more so than the mother, in fact probably less.

My point is that with all of the same basic tools to start out with such as fingers, opposable thumbs and walking upright, there is no reason why only our line evolved to the level that human beings have attained with the same hundreds of millions of years, and the same pressures pushing us all forward, or towards extinction.

3067	0	a	I think they are doing it out of fear. They see the moral decline in America and they have latched onto the GLBT Community as their scapegoat. Since it's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences, it's not PC to go after other religions (especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. Insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. It's easier that way.

The myth of Eve: molecular biology and human origins.Ayala FJ.University of California, Irvine, USA.It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the ""mitochondrial Eve"" who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies."

An Einstein, of course, is much more useful to a much greater number of people, but from the simple point of view of whether he is more of a person, I would say not.

3153	0	a	jessica, all these problems you've listed, the human body takes care of automatically and remarkably well. the fact still remains that only less than 5% of all abortions occur because the risk is great enough to be deemed life-threatening to either tha mother or the child. and that percentage is diminishing as well. the overwhelming majority of abortions occur simply because the woman decides she does not wnat to be a mother.

3168	0	a	Exactly. Trying to prove that God, if he exists, didn't make us as good as an all powerful being should have made us doesn't prove anything in the God debate. I could always debate that since God is all powerful and all knowing he could have always thought of something better to do. If he made those changes, then of course there would still be something better he could have thought of. This would be an endless loop of creating something better and better until finally he would have to stop and say that is good enough. But even then this debate that he didn't make us as good as he could have would be valid in my view.

3184	0	a	Is that a trick question? No, the tabloid and other gutter press keep going on about how bad it is, because they sell papers by fanning fear and hatred, and fear of crime is one of their biggest markets. Yes there has been an increase in gun crime over the years, but that's largely attributable to increased attractiveness of crime in a society where social mobility has come to a standstill. In any case the number of incidents where firearms are used in crime is still very small, which is why every time someone gets shot it is headline news.   Guns are incredibly rare in this country, the only time I've seen guns in real life (other than air rifles) is on a military base.

They don't want to lose votes and possible support from gun owners for their priorities like health care reform because of a difference of opinion on gun control policy. They know that the Republicans are going to hit them with everything they've got during election time and exaggerated accusations about the Democrats wanting to take away people's guns would hurt them. The Republicans learned during the Clinton years that creating as much as paranoia as possible about the Democrats supporting big government is the way to regain a majority in Congress. It's all politics.

And it does not seem that the Constitution allows for a legislative session that never ends. I'm not sure how else to square the two except that the legislature should pursue final action. Of course, as you have pointed out, it really is hard to speculate on this one without any historical context of the amended Amendment Process, and/or the relevant legal precedent surrounding it.

3261	1	a	wow, your sex life is based on relativity? i assumed you were quick, but not that bad.
3262	1	a	wait so being bullied is infringing on your rights? well no duh but if i 'bucko' have to deal with it on a daily basis just for the fact that i'm slightly different i'm not surprised someone has to deal with it for their sexuality. and if they just dealt with the fact they were gay, accepted it and realized that other people aren't the end all and be all, that they'd eventually find people who accepted them for who they were and that high school wasn't the world maybe they'd still be alive.
3263	1	a	1868 actually, that is a link to the wikipedia article on the act. once again, the 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 are not the same thing. more importantly, a store saying 'no blacks allowed' is not violating the 14th, they violate the civil rights act of 1964. furthermore, a store saying 'no guns allowed' is not violated the 2nd amendment.  time for you to read up on the constitution doc, you might find some good things in there. i'm a little surprised you don't vote democrat given your thoughts. then again, not much difference between a given democrat and your texas 'republicans' (see w bush and rick perry)
3264	1	a	i love how your sources never support your point. well, i wasn't able to find out about the rebellions of christianity from your source, but it did show some positive points, so i guess that was good.
3265	1	a	why? that doesn't make alot of sense. we say gas go over $2 during a period of relatively low demand. why would gas stabalize that a price that is lower then what it was during a period of low demand when high demand is projected with increases consumption in china the us and the industralized world as a whole? oh yes, i'm asking the person who thinks that cds are good investments during periods of low inflation. emoticonxrolleyes
3266	1	a	i love how you're pretending to not know your way around the 50 character minimum... that's cute.
3267	1	a	oh dear she's attacking everyone now obviously a very unhappy kitten .... and i can't even pray for her...and if you can't take tantrum throwing stop doing it, try work on that new word you have invented or your punctuation and spelling , or print up your global warming theory prove all them science folk wrong .... may even get a noble prize ( beats beauty school) ... go get them tiger ....,.
3268	1	a	do you actually think that asking worthless questions will help your side? oh wait, obviously you do, that's all you ever ask. why are you trying so hard to deny the fact that conception originates a new organism?  irrelevant  that conception is the beginning of that new organism's life and physical existence? irrelevant that conception is in that respect, the birth of a new organism?  my definition does not allow for this conclusion. why does that fact bother you so much? if you are right, then all words are worthless and meaningless. if you are right every word means every other word.
3269	1	a	oh, usa is a fiiiiiiiiine one to tell 'make love, not war.' to our fantastic nation!
3270	1	a	wow...just...wow! seriously, my post pretty well just saaaaailed on over yer lil head, didn't it? that 'ol stupid train...just kept runnin over ya, didn't it? runnin over ya! lol i guess my incredibly obvious cynical sarcasm was just not ~quite~ earth shatteringly obvious ~enough~, huh sparkles? tha'fawk...they sure are breeding you kids slow these days! you be sure and have fun trying to 'debate' something which has been made totally irrelevant by modern technology! :d 'gun control'...lol, you trainables might as well be arguing for earthquake control! aha ha ha ha ha ha! you don't ~control~ earthquakes, you prepare for them! herpity derp!
3271	1	a	perhaps you should smoke a lot less crack? funny isn't it how the people who say that invariably want a larger government? btw adam smith, aka 'miguel sanchez', is a prominent mexican free market economist and spiritual leader of the latino pride movement, with suspected ties to people smuggling and drug trafficking operations along the californian border. his magnum opus the wealth of mexicans details an insidious plot to bring down racial equality through free market principles, estabilishing a millenium of full spectrum mexican dominance of the american financial, legal and industrial systems. the only barrier to his evil plot? patriotic americans who understand the benefits of government control in all aspects of their lives. i'm surprised someone as educated on such a diverse array of issues as yourself hasn't come across him.
3272	1	a	i am very impressed with your ability to copy and paste links. now what this proves about what you know about it is still unproven. unless you are the one in the videos giving the lectures...and he looks like he has been studying this longer then 'almost a decade'. nice try though. what proof can you give that is pertinent to the debate about how that disproves an eternal being? also you may want to get with some of the other atheists on the site because they were pushing the eternal universe and big bounce theories as explanations in other debates. you all should get your scientific consensus on the same page.
3273	1	a	i'm not surprised that you didn't get the point that i wasn't really questioning his spelling when i replied to his 'you are heavy on the inane claims... ' with 'you mean accurate claims. your spelling sucks. emoticonxrolleyes ' but rather his statement. but that's ok, we know some people have difficulty with adult concepts such as sarcasm.
3274	1	a	dude, check my results. i'm shocked. i answered honestly. wow. you were def right, i aint no liberal. o.o
3275	1	a	if it were up to the thought pattern of individuals that produces this, then not only would we be speaking with a british accent because the left can't stomach any war that goes beyoned five years, but you would have left adolph hitler alone too until he invaded poland.  and for the record, the u.n. isn't working on sanctions against iran because they are good and innocent, but because they feel, like i and many others do, that iran is engaging in deceptive and non-cooperative behaviors. and when the darling of the liberal left - the u.n. - feels that way, then maybe there's a lot more to it than you think you know. by the way, how did you like that fatwa for nuclear weapons?
3276	1	a	i love it when 'heathens' try to tell me what my religion does or doesn't do. emoticonxrolleyes  ah yes, here come the personal attacks. duo must be getting desperate again.
3277	1	a	oh yeah, there's a whole section of the country (the grain belt or maybe the midwest) that eats these things 2 or 3 times a day. sometimes even for desert.... ...okay i was kidding about that last part, but still.
3278	1	a	much more is happening in the world today than your little gay crusade matthew. but keep your single issue, and totally limited perspective in life, that's what you're good at. could you post where i said that revelation speaks to the rcc vs the protestant reformation ms ? as christ was a jew trebor, his followers wont ever cease to exist, just as god has preserved the jew according to his promises. i'm surprised you can't appreciate that my friend.
3279	1	a	oh yeah you're right! i suppose only sane americans get guns! no wonder 0% of the population are killed in gun warfare. oh wait, a considerable amount of people are killed by guns. silly me! of course all the sane people can also shoot who they want in some states, just because they feel threatened by it. sure keep guns, advocate them why don't you. after all, all those people killed, and the families of those people.. hasn't happened to you, so why should you care?!?! (noob...)
3280	1	a	i love how the rightie wingnuts think that obama is a socialist muslim when their own mentally defective vp nominee is a practicing member of the pentacostal church, and a creationist. at least obama's head is screwed on properly.
3281	1	a	the ones that make you stupid. you are so passionate about this thing that your judgment is impaired. i am kind surprised that you let your emotions influence your quest for truth. atlas shrugged is as dangerous as the bible and people like you are as bad as religious fundamentalists.
3282	1	a	oh really? where might i see this cowboy? might i have some evidence to support your appalling claims? pick any cowboy movie .. any
3283	1	a	he can't sin, get a teenage girl knocked up on a one night stand, but not sin. slaughter innocents personally or command his followers to do so but can't sin. oh yes he isn't very good at watching out for his kids. i mean look at adam and eve and then he got another chance with jesus and look how that turned out. and see above for other things he can't do.
3284	1	a	there is no problem in what you 'believe' in. science is irrelevant in many beliefs. just sole belief in a deity and his disciples, is what many religions revolve around. but, i am astounded by your god's name, no harsh feelings. a dragon lord king is quite a mouth full don't you say? can we just call em, greeble. :)
3285	1	a	wow! i didn't know that. thanks! should i read the new york times instead?
3286	1	a	you really need to stop reading such biased, uninformed digital-age fishwrapper. i can think of at least one instance off the top of my head, justice alito's confirmation. the democrats threatened to filibuster bush's scotus choice. the gang of seven democrats agreed not to filibuster in return for the republicans not to use the 'nuclear option'. it was in all of the papers. i'm surprised that the leftwing rag missed it. emoticonxrolleyes
3287	1	a	oh yeah god is the root of all evil! tell that to the person who was about to murder their spouse for cheating but refrained from doing so because they believe that god is watching. how about that damn evil mother theresa too
3288	1	a	it looks like you have tried to analize everything i say as being 'my' life experiences. i really enjoy your abuse , i would love to meet up with you some day. my life is fantastic actually. i dont know why i have to keep repeating that. what about those in haiti right now ? what about others? i think they are more important than your fucking sulking over the americans lousy pronunciations.or me whining over you being an arsehole. as for amy winehouse , no reputable establishment would dare touch the skank.
3289	1	a	another attack from one who claims to be a loving christian. oh well, i'm not surprised.
3290	1	a	i must be blessed to be surrounded by so many posters with a direct line to god so that they know who is saved or in hell. with christians as well-informed as this, i'm surprised god doesn't just retire and let them take over. after all, 6,000 years since creation must be enough for anyone.
3291	1	a	look. it responded again. i swear, it just gets funnier. look at how far he's managed to fool himself: ' you are pissed at me for simply speaking the undeniable truth. does the truth normally piss you off?' lol. i'm not surprised that a skinhead and potential kkk member thinks that his perspective is absolute while everyone else's is inferior.
3292	1	a	i love when differing from someones opinion is 'weak'. such a convincing argument.
3293	1	a	i am surprised to hear you, a card-carrying christian, defending the civil rights of polygamists! wonders will never cease!  obviously the point flew right past your noggin. gay people are discriminated against because they are gay! but then, you folk think that's just fine. a few years ago, you'd have been blowing hard about 'activist' judges allowing interracial marriage. how dare they stand up for equal rights! emoticonxrolleyes
3294	1	a	child, your assumption is not only simplistic, childish and patently ridiculous, but it is coming from you so i'm not surprised at all that you're making it. you can deduce and somehow read into my rejection of your statement being evidence of anything is claiming that christianity is the only religion, but i made clear above that my only intent was to show that your claim that your siggy proves anything at all is patently absurd. but make of it what you will. i'll give you the last word to spew your lies and delusions about what you want to say i believe. so have at it little boy, er, i mean, child. emoticonxbye
3295	1	a	774 billion to china in debt... where are you going to 'buy' new technology? oh right... from china.
3296	1	a	lol, i love how everyone seems to feel the need to out-wit rk even after over 50 days xd
3297	1	a	archie, it's already 'cleared up' that you're a liar. you claimed to know what he was about. you claimed it was a 'secular site that's dedicated to exposing the homosexual, extreme left, communist and anarchist agenda'. but he's not really interested in 'homosexuality' at all. and i find you're 'couldn't find it' to be incredibly absurd. it's on the web-page where he talks about the event in the first place. if you actually start clicking to see the pics and his comments, it's right there! i'm not linking to pornographic material on this web-site. the header of that web-page reads:  'up your alley fair san francisco, july 27, 2008 part 1' i am incredibly amused that you repeatedly lie all over the place on this web-site, but then you press others for proof.
3298	1	a	oh hun i am sorry, i'll get right on that :) but yes i retouched her scars, she's a cutter for sure...
3299	1	a	she was never 'pro-gun' to you people. she was an anti. omg they reported on something. not exactly ready to help her reputation out before she was shot, though, were they? you have lots of bros that are lunatics. and one of them just shot and murdered 6 people, including a federal judge who was sitting on an immigration case and a congresswoman who opposed to arizona's immigration law. arizona: your land of cowgirl jan and cowboy sheriff joe.  i never heard of anyone who truly understood what a soul was, who thought they didn't need a mirror. i'm not surprised you think yourself at the level of god himself, able to judge who has a soul and who doesn't. it's the same psychology your bro with a gun just demonstrated.
3300	1	a	it's my first day and i'm already wishing forums had an ignore button. this really is my first day, and i am frankly flabbergasted. is this (archie-types) an ongoing problem here, or an isolated individual? i feel like i'm arguing with my 6 year old niece. i'm asking everyone out there who has been there for a while. seriously. as a former christian, i have numerous christian friends whose conversation and opinions i respect and think i could learn something from - but, well...jesus, is this the norm around here? this is not a rhetorical question.
3301	1	a	she? uh, you don't know me like that, miss thing. you're the one with more pudenda than the pointer sisters. and i'm not eating any attention. i'm mildly amused. i haven't seen any evidence of your reputed prowess here. and why don't you ask the real monkey to dance? somebody at home.
3302	1	a	oh dear.another one that gets a hard on when they see a typo....emoticonxchicken
3303	1	a	first of all, let me just say that that is an excellent whitesnake song. but i'm a little surprised!emoticonxwow all the complaints i got about giving out my personal problems and here you are complaining about wanting a relationship. does no one else see the irony in this? the problem is obvious to me. okay i take that back, it really isn't. does going to kichen supply stores really help?
3304	1	a	i'm shocked! shocked, i say!!! you seem so pure! roflmao....sorry!
3305	1	a	wrong again daewoo; but at least you are painfully consistent. i am merely pointing out the hypocrisy and level of ignorance obama displays every time he opens his economically clueless and divisive mouth. but then, who would ever accuse you of getting anything right? once again, the buffet rule is for the gullible and clueless to glom onto in a vacuum of reality and the fact that it would do nothing to solve this nations problems and is merely a diversion from the massive failure this president has been, more so than even carter.  i cant say i am surprised you would glom onto such an idiot talking point.  it is only strange for someone who is so completely clueless that they cannot even comprehend a simple thread premise.  so were you born this clueless, or deliberately play the role of someone who is patently clueless?
3306	1	a	if we killed more people that were guilty of their crime more people would not want to commit the crime because of the circumstances. if they don't care about the circumstances they are insane. 'i think, about what they've done wrong in society is by teaching/encouraging/inspiring them, not killing.' so you want the government to brainwash them?  are you kidding me? what planet do you live on?! 'oh, you killed someone but we're not going to punish you at all you just have to go to therapy.' you're joking right?
3307	1	a	i'm always astonished that creationists try the 'lots of cultures have stories about floods' gambit.  yes, lots of cultures have stories about many things. either there was one great flood at one time, or there have been individual floods. since humans tend to congregate in river valleys, i think i know why all the flood stories contradict each other...
3308	1	a	were it so simple. for the agents to 'freely assemble' among us they, or their superiors, must conclude that we are some sort of threat. would that make you feel loved? on a side note, i'm always surprised at how 'conservatives', normally so worried about government waste, take such a waste of taxpayer dollars so glibly. fbi investigating kiss-ins? joining subversive 'terrorist' xxxx biker groups?
3309	1	a	oh, how about the other states charge a special fee to inspect anything imported from kalifornia? seems like there was a little trade war going on over oj from florida and texas once and kalifornia lost.  what does the constitution of the u.s. say about powers prohibited to the states? reckon kalifornia is bound by the u.s. constitution? emoticonxagree
3310	1	a	i love it when straight, christian folk who disapprove of gays seem to know so much about what it is to be gay - how it feels, how they became that way, the nature of their relationships and whether or not its something they can control. hey archangel - if you ever need brain surgery i know a fantastic auto mechanic you can talk to. emoticonxrolleyes
3311	1	a	oh yes matt, i'm just an angry little ogre who can't stand to think that gays might find happiness in this lifetime, [sarcasm]. get a clue matthew, i have no personal investment at all regarding your life or your lifestyle. all i'm doing is sharing the spiritual truths that you hate to hear or consider. don't blame me because you live a life of delusions and self deception, because that is the life you are living. and none of those so called good people who encourage and show tolerance for your chosen lifestyle are your friends at all. and yet you prefer their lies to my truth. go figure huh?
3312	1	a	wow nice job! the 50 character limit is hard to reach and it is a waste of time but up vote for you!
3313	1	a	that's me, and proud of it. but i guess you get your jollies when pagan religious symbols or a pagan religious event can be displayed / practiced, but to heck with anything that might resemble christianity? real nice and equitable there, moose.  it got me a lot of 'excellent!' and 'way to go!' remarks from a number of co-workers.  bull. i've seen it, though it's been many decades now. get real. halloween itself is a pagan religious event, if you will do some research for a change. once again, pagan-related religious themes are fine, but screw the christians.  aren't you one of the libs who tries to sell their 'tolerance' (except for anything christian)? reckon so.
3314	1	a	i have several that i want everyone who engages in the 'man caused global warming' debate to consider.... and i thank you for helping to illustrate some of those points for me (bold text above). asside from the points we've already discussed,... i am a bit intrigued by the fact that many of your ilk (concerned about saving the lives of millions by reversing or slowing the warming trends of the planet) are seemingly oblivious and uncaring about the millions who are deliberately killed in the name of 'choice.' isn't the decision to drive an suv a choice as well? emoticonxrolleyes
3315	1	a	not likely waxy: i just thought snakespit's scornful post would have been more effective if he hadn't used 'dear' three times when he meant 'deer'.
3316	1	a	your reputation  la savoir faire with dirty notes precedes you, darling. no need for mommy's little boy to wiggle down his pants and expose himself some more. meaning, too, your ignorance, not mine, since the connection between the vietnam war, rubber production and american tire manufacturers is documented and known. go visit your local c.i.a. source for further information, dw, for starters.  be sure to take your teacher clown nosey with you.
3317	1	a	Al will need to get a little fitter before the fight but I reckon he could take him!
3318	1	a	this seems like a begging the question fallacy. lets just assume that they 'do not' have control over it...it would be the same thing for an alcoholic (which people are also born with). are you saying alcoholics should be allowed to live in this lifestyle? i guess it is societies fault emoticonxrolleyes looks like jyoshu's reactions were correct for you i am pretty surprised no one is like 'yeah, this is still a problem'..instead they are going '25%...that aint too bad'. even worse, they blame other people. in fact, robbie says gay men are acting 'recklessly' because they aren't treated as 'normal', yet he believes that gay men are ready to have families. how can you be reckless yet be ready for a family?..or rather, a good family?
3319	1	a	isn't that amazing that you were the fool all along? oh wait, you are to simple-minded to understand that. carry on.
3320	1	a	That has to be a typo my friend. If you can compress the EB into only 1012 bits then you can write your own ticket in the field of data compression! Lets see 100 million pages into 1012 bits - fantastic - please tell us how. I really would like to put the entire literature of mankind (and more) on an Ipod.
3321	1	a	gee, i'm just bowled over by your mature and articulate counterargument.emoticonxrolleyes we all know genitals have nothing to do with sex.
3322	1	a	i am none too surprised to see that the point was totally and utterly lost on you.
3323	1	a	i so love it when you have to work so hard to avoid any points i made. i take it as assent to my original post.
3324	1	a	wow, so everyone else is just wrong. no chance you could be? i am willing to bet that you also disagree with many christians or they disagree with you at least.
3325	1	a	wow, in your very warped world view, people with moral values that defend the most defenseless among us and speak for those who can't speak for themselves are seen as morally perverted by you? how terribly pathetic of you capo. but sadly, i'm not the least bit surprised at how incredibly shallow your perspective is. what boggles the mind though is that you're unable to empathize with a whole class of human beings whom you once were yourself. just think about it capo, can you see what that say's about you?
3326	1	a	psh if i had to f*&^ hillary i'd cheat too! i mean i'm gay but lord have mercy! lol... but getting back to the subject at hand. simone hun honestly just stop with the cook theories and whoever else even believes them. bush and dick had no idea of 9/11 we all didn't.  i find it a sad irony that we discover the warning signs after the incident... we're only human and we all make mistakes... oh and fyi we did not land on the moon.. simone told me it was made of cheese and that there were giant moon rats eating and eating until one day the moon will be gone... that's why there are holes in it. it's true!!! honestly!
3327	1	a	reckon you'll be eating your own words in due time, moose.  not from what i've seen so far in your posts. keep plugging, though, you may find god yet when you run out of all those ill-conceived arguments against him.
3328	1	a	wow, i am surprised you didn't say 'kill the retards.'
3329	1	a	there it is, at the top in bold letters. reckon you can find it now?
3330	1	a	'some people just need killin'' - that sounds just fantastic!
3331	1	a	leroyjames, i am just shocked at your blatantly sarcastic response to kelly ;)
3332	1	a	yes..but what is the difference between killing for fun and killing by mistake???? you drive your big suv to work every day...how many animals do you accidently kill? how many insects? oh wait, you judge a life by how big the life is...ignorant humans!
3333	1	a	i was not trying to convince anyone. so what the hell is your point man? oh right there is no point. you are just trying to be an uncouth lout.
3334	1	a	oh yes...because mainstream science is concocting one big hoax just to brainwash you. it's a conspiracy of rabid scientists. emoticonxrolleyes we all know you know much more that scientific peer reviewed journals and the scientific method, right? you're scientific credentials?
3335	1	a	no i'm not. well you certainly should be. to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that? wow...i'd say i'm surprised but i'm really not. so you're saying that people who don't want a baby stupid enough to have unprotected sex are on an equal playing field with those who properly applied protection which failed? that's ludicrous and you really should know better.  well. with condoms.. you have no baby. and with abortion, you don't have any baby either.. you left out a few important details there buddy. with the killing of a 3-month old with an axe you have no baby. but its the same result! yippee!
3336	1	a	jesus christ srom!!! you live in the stone age... i'm surprised you have internet access.
3337	1	a	well, i am not surprised you think science is a cult. i guess you think everything you don't understand is a cult. emoticonxrolleyes
3338	1	a	i totes love how your arguments doesn't even tell us what your answer is since you laughed a question that had two sides open for agreement or disagreement.
3339	1	a	and yet you ignored the specific link mentioning the current regs while asking for it at the same time.  no, i dislike your techniches because they are unethical, hold double standards, and aren't based on facts.  oh yes, who was the one who asked for the reg link while ignoring it at the same time?  the fact that you quote newsmax says much about how much credence anyone here gives you.
3340	1	a	that explains your excellent use of grammar, word choice and spelling? rotflmao
3341	1	a	oh no you didn't! not g earnst website?  oh yes you did! that would be like me quoting from nato's website.  po tow mack institute emoticonxsmilie  potomac river humm.
3342	1	a	the evidence that is provided to you is not enough. not that evidence is not given.  nice closed-minded-ness buddy.  ethnocentrism? lol! you're kidding right? you think what i wrote is particular and not broad ranged? what are you assuming here?
3343	1	a	oh yes, the flood that left no trace of ever occuring. gotta fear the threat of nothing! i'm so afraid of a flood that never happened!  as for sodom, well, i practice good hospitality. i don't know about you. you know, god isn't going to be happy when you keep limiting its power by calling it a 'he' all the time. god is limitless, it has no gender.
3344	1	a	which leaves us with? if you said 'an appeal to majority' you win teh prize! you're not really leaving it to them when you're talking about enacting legislation based on a theory which is still under debate. most doctors won't prescribe marijuana in this country either. i guess we should just leave that to them though, since they're more qualified.
3345	1	a	anyone else see the irony? i don't have time to look up my facts, but i'll just say my opinions are facts!  let's just ignore that overall, republican adminstrations have more officials indicted or convicted of state & federal laws. nixon's adminstration alone accounts for many of the republican number (golwater called nixon the most dishonest person he'd ever met in his life). and do we need to remind jim of the ratio of republicans who have gone to jail or been indicted compared to democrats in the past 6 years?  right. strom thurmand laughs at you from his grave.  with a ideology like that, i'm not surprised.
3346	1	a	so.... whats he been doing for the past two thousand years? i'm sure this rapture probably requires a lot of paperwork.... i mean, if you're going to torture and murder millions of people i guess you better have all your t's crossed and i's dotted huh?
3347	1	a	loll i love how you completely ignore the link i posted ehh?? and then you downvoted me and tried to sound smart afterwards, but actually made yourself look like twice a fool. :d. you better upvote me again. smh. hah.
3348	1	a	i love how you managed to advocate reading the bible all the while pile slamming insults on it. pure brilliance. :d
3349	1	a	oh yes we do think so. as you know very well where that figure came from.  the latest study at harvard. new study finds 45,000 deaths annually linked to lack of health coverage | harvardscience interesting, isn't it, how our side is always quoting figures from harvard and such, and all your ilk can dig up is 'townhall' and hannity's second grade collages.
3350	1	a	i am not his buddy. my objection was that you thought he was english( please tell me he's not) and that your perception of english people was wrong and insulting i do not care whether american ( or should i be a prat like you and call you a yank?)people carry guns or not and have never supported his argument. looking at some of your stupid smug posts i am not surprised that you need a gun for protection. look in the mirror fella and you will see penfold mk ii.
3351	1	a	yes let's all cheer on the glorified shameless point-farming bitch of this site.
3352	1	a	i love it when christians say this...pay who, for what, whose sin? if he is god, no one had to die for anything. he could blink his eyes and everything would be as he wanted!
3353	1	a	wow, this was up to 6 points at one time. down-voting it without a rebuttal surely refutes it.
3354	1	a	oh yes that was very enlightening, could i get the stick drawing anyway?
3355	1	a	you sound like such a great guy deliberately pissing off a person you call your friend. if that is what you call good works then i am truly impressed.
3356	1	a	no my dear, nor am i one of those cuckoo-brains who believe that obama is the best thing since sliced bread.
3357	1	a	wow! well what do you think that thing is in a woman's womb? a giraffe? with how stupid you are, i wouldn't be surprised if you were a giraffe,
3358	1	a	tennis? you're joking right? it's already been proven that women can take on a man anytime in that game! others not so much but tennis most definately!
3359	1	a	oh yeah, you got me. bigotry and hate are major turn on for me. you could use a good lay anyway. muah. ;0
3360	1	a	oh yeah because someone else getting involved and helping them wage war on palestine for daring to live in their own country is really likely to prevent the war from escalating.
3361	1	a	nor do i understand how buying materialistic items or receiving them is very christian yes!!! thankyou!!! i'm glad someone finally said it! now what was one of the deadly sins of christianity? oh right, greed. hypocrisy much?
3362	1	a	huh. explain why you call people bush haters and use personal attacks yourself when you're running out of ammo? oh yes, it's because you're a hypocrite. i'm voice of treason, i can call people all the horrible names i want, but the minute they say one bad thing about me, i whine like a little girl about how it;'s so unfair and how they are meanies!
3363	1	a	as i said, for clarification, and no other reason. it's all drivel to me anyway, so i didn't see the problem in adding evolution onto theory. show where it said that if you would, and clarify your question. if you'll notice, it said approximately, not exactly half its life. i'm surprised you couldn't deduce that by just reading what it said. why are you asking me this question smiley as if i wrote the article? can't you tell the difference between quoting a piece and writing it?
3364	1	a	"'Life threatening condition that is always physically harmful""? What a giant load of steamy BS. Rarely is pregnancy physically harmful and even rarer is it life threatening. There are over 6 Billion people on this earth today. If motherhood was so damn dangerous, don't you think the population would be a lot lower, even if it was just due to mothers keeling over after giving birth? Where do you get this BS from, Planned Parenthood?"
3365	1	a	only you would consider accepting donations equivalent to charging a fee moose. as if the two are at all similar. after all, one is a mandatory charge, while the other is an optional donation.  and i'm not going to defend the rapture at all, but don't you think it's a bit premature to assume it will never happen?
3366	1	a	oh yeah. way easier. which is why gay marriage has come such a long way since it started. ;) marriage would only be removed from any legal document. it will still appear in religious documents. the compromise will be a hell of a lot more amicable than the tension that currently exists.
3367	1	a	oh yeah, it's a real brain teaser. who would have thought it's possible for someone to have two parents?
3368	1	a	i'm surprised that some of the more frothing liberals here have not yet suggested that we now have a way of tracking and potentially treating the 'abnormal' brains of conservatives.
3369	1	a	i'm surprised to learn that you have the slightest idea about biology. also, your spelling and grammar is ever so much better in this post than your posts in another thread. how many of you are pretending to be a poster named vt?
3370	1	a	you're kidding right? the quangbar tangrians will be abducting you and the rest of the human souls at the end of the world. everyone knows this.
3371	1	a	i love how the government has become the scapegoat for the failure of parents to control their kids, and in turn we are losing more and more civil liberties...
3372	1	a	to be honest, i'm surprised it was that hard to give a corporate handout. any big insurance company and big drug company is delighted since their competition will now be squashed and the average joe will delight in their weaker care at a higher price. but hey, a for effort, right? emoticonxrolleyes you don't get points for failing to deliver or delivering a failure in my opinion.
3373	1	a	i am surprised scientists havn't made so much of a fuss about you. wow......
3374	1	a	ok, the absolutly positively true story. god did exist. but, satan being the wiley deciever he is got him with that very clever paradox ploy. 'god, if you are truely all powerful, can you make yourself not exist?' satan asked. 'but of course.' he replied and with that...*poof* he was gone. that explains why he doesn't do anything. no miracles, no prayers answer, nothing...he's gone. and, for those fools who doubt this, i refer you to the book of job. witness how god jumps to the tune of satan when god withdraws his protection from his loyal and faithful servant...merely to prove a point to satan...without cause!
3375	1	a	i love how you point out the obvious . like what's already been implied in the statement. lol.
3376	1	a	a: when it comes to civil rights, the'majority' does not rule!!!!!!!!!!! i suggest you 'float your boat' in the direction of the vatican city, as you have already proven that your first allegiance is to there, not to the usa of which you presume to be a citizen. emoticonxrolleyes  so what would you have us do? stand by silently while you promote the dogma of a sovereign foreign power (vatican city) to control the rights of us citizens? with your bigoted attitude, i am totally surprised yu are not advocating a constitutional ammendment to make the rcc the one, only, and required legal religion in the usa with the pope as chief executive. emoticonxrolleyes emoticonxrolleyes
3377	1	a	wow!! your such a guy! i bet you watch lingere womens football too dont you. womens basketball is on a much higher level then men. i bet you couldnt even tell me what a shot clock, three point shot, foul shot, or even what layup is. maybe if your tried watching womens basketball you would see how it is on a high skill level and how some wnba teams could beat mba teams.
3378	1	a	lol bias dysfunctions. i'm surprised you know such a long word. pity you don't know what it means. i can't blame you... being a retarded ignorant white woman. you don't even understand the absurdity of your own beliefs. go back to cleaning the house. worse is that you don't work yet you take the piss out of immigrants who work but don't pay taxes. you're better how?
3379	1	a	i know! i should totally be sorry and ashamed for being such a horrible liar... i mean a dick sucking homosexual and a liar! oh i'm going to the seventh circle for sure... except one little tidbit easilyridden. i didn't lie!!!  embarrass? hun you forget who wears the tiara in this forum....
3380	1	a	i do not understand how sexism, slavery and filicide fit into a being that is supposed to be infinitely moral. care to justify that for me? oh wait... you can't.
3381	1	a	oh yes those horrible wicked gays that will distroy families and consume morality as we know it.
3382	1	a	oh dear, he already added to the gene pool. emoticonxrolleyes
3383	1	a	seven demons, huh? is that a lot? small chance of clean living with those guys on board, huh? interesting. i am intrigued that you believe in demons. do they still exist? if so, how are they manifest and how would you know that?
3384	1	a	i'm surprised that so many people got their knickers in a knot over the ramblings of pat robinson. emoticonxwow
3385	1	a	i just told you how. if you want to change your gender, then go ahead... but comparing it to changing clothes is just idiotic.  oh yeah! i forgot, you already think the entire human race is stupid... so i guess you have an excuse.
3386	1	a	i assume you are christian? do you follow everything in the bible? i guess you better get stoning of your neighbors going then for working on sunday and wearing blended fabric. oh yes i do take offense that you want to kill gay people since you believe that you can't ignor some parts of the bible. you are then comanded to kill gay people, prostitutes, and smartmouthed children.
3387	1	a	oh yeah, that's right.... i forgot ;) i'm getting dementia already ;) well, i guess that if i don't make it to heaven (due to all the liberals i've tormented over the years) i'll be so busy shaking hands with all of my friends that i wont have time to worry ;)
3388	1	a	oh yeah? tell that to the next person you see running down the street wielding a knife. ;)
3389	1	a	i'm surprised that your picture doesn't precede the phrase 'ignorance of actual american history' in every encyclopedia on earth, simone. emoticonxdonno emoticonxfrazzled emoticonxic emoticonxwow
3390	1	a	i am more amused than anything else. i don't have to 'attack your character', you do a much better job at showing exactly what you are made of than anybody else can.
3391	1	a	i just like the author...i'm surprised a single person even knows who he is with the level of society's litterary intelligence. emoticonxsmilie
3392	1	a	i love it when people manipulate statistics in order to attempt to prove a causal relationship that doesn't exist. considering the fact that more women vote than men, one could argue that their views are over-represented.
3393	1	a	what a shock. easy can't make a cogent point, so he starts ranting scripture and threatening damnation. let me type up his response: '<flush> let's see how smart you are when you're suffering in the pit, you obama-ade drinker.'
3394	1	a	wow, there you go again. first we can cut health care costs by hiring lots and lots of doctors and nurses and building lots more hospitals... which have to be, you know, paid for. now we can cut postal rates by hiring lots and lots more delivery people! who have to be, you know, paid. in your view it seems that any cost can be reduced by spending more money... it's fascinating really.
3395	1	a	i hope you're joking, otherwise i suggest you see a psychiatrist as soon as possible. people are more important than animals. you can like animals, you can even love animals, you can not want to eat animals, but when you start thinking they're more important than babies you have serious issues.
3396	1	a	yes, that is certainly going to stop you from a gunman. 'dear god.... please save this soul'
3397	1	a	wow, you're clever. and some things are dumb. ex, choosing to die when you have the option to live. your lame analogies aside, (yeah, i used the word lame again) one can find new people to hang out with. and again, instead of answering my arguement, you decide to try and insult me. you're right, i must be the one who is dumb...
3398	1	a	i'm quite surprised this hasn't got more attention. usually all you have to do is whisper the word abortion around here and there's a firestorm. not that that was what i was going for, i'm just surprised. maybe this article is just too straightforward for people emoticonxangel
3399	1	a	never said anything about a 'lost speech'. but who knows? he may have had his speech writers prepare half a dozen different speeches. the community organizer knows when to push and when to back off. there was enough of a public outcry for him to realize that this was not the time to push. so he backed off and wasted the country's time by re-hashing old wisdoms. i am rather amused about the labels thrown out by you, simon and foundit. just because i had the audacity to criticize the anointed one i am a hysterical racist. keep them coming.
3400	1	a	atheists believe in god.... they just don't want to believe in god because they are in rebellion to god maybe in your mind, because you can't see a world without god. a parallel is that of a parent and child. so atheists are naughty children? and he or she then rebells to the point of extreme anger. atheists are extremely angry? oh right, like those atheist terrorists, or the atheists that campaign at the funerals of dead soldiers. atheists are just angry at god for no real reason care to prove this?
3401	1	a	i guess i'm not really surprised at some of the reaction here: ignorant blather. i am dissappointed though. it's amazing what people will say about something with no knowledge of it. yes.
3402	1	a	More heretical misinformation from dear old cap0.  'Zionism is Racism' - a Dead Issue
3403	1	a	reproduction oh yeah, because our 7 billion high population, with estimates for 10 billion by the end of the century, really needs to force gay people to do it. if the person is religious in the christian religion, it only damns those who sleep with another man as he does a women. your sexual orientation itself is not bad. and anyway, it's their own problem, love the sinner, hate the sin, as jesus said. i'm not sure about other religions specific text against gays. if he wants to. i talked about how people shouldn't be forced to, i said that some people could.
3404	1	a	the moon is made of cheese because i said so. was i persuasive? neither were you. do you have the capability to actually debate with facts? you saying something is true doesn't make it so. oh, and i'll save you the trouble.. i'm going to burn in hell, i'm, how does it go? spiritually challenged? and oh yeah, i'm going to bring about something called rapture or something like that. lol
3405	1	a	wow! i've never thought about it like that. you've given that a lot of thought ;)
3406	1	a	a minute without kids? what's that? :) and about the thread - it might be a touchy subject. reckon? oh, and thanks - i feel 28! emoticonxcool
3407	1	a	what a shocker. let me paraphrase: anyone: not following you aa, can you support or clarify what you're saying here? aa: nope!
3408	1	a	i probably wasted time creating this debate. everyone knows blacks commit more crime than other races. who in their right mind is going to argue with that? oh wait, aveskde would argue with a sign post if it was crucial to holding his fantastical world-view together, maybe he'll bite. :)  you're projecting. you'll find that few things enrage me or emotionally motivate me.
3409	1	a	what are they doing at the marshals service anyway besides losing two way radios? maybe, they should just radio it in to find them, oh wait, they can't, they are lost.
3410	1	a	i love it when hypocrites say that we are no longer old testament law but proceed to quote the old testament that they just dismissed making themselves out to be fools and hypocrites. you can not have it both ways. either the old testament applies, or it does not. also, do you play football, wear polyester, stuff like that? those are abominations too. for more abominations, read leviticus 11. damn, this is a jolly good time!
3411	1	a	oh really? ever voluntarily flown in a plane by any chance? taken medication for anything, or received a vaccination?
3412	1	a	i can't help it if fairy tales are dear to your heart dude, i'm just telling it like it is.  christians all over the country try to claim the gospels are in harmony..and very rarely , if ever, have i found a christian who will admit the contradictions in the bible. they try to explain away contradictions with lies and made up versions of their own but will never admit the truth.... no loss here, i have never since i came here hid the fact i do not like religion. it's nothing personal against anyone in particular, but if you happen to be religious and fall under the weight of truth i can't help if your feelings get hurt. would you rather me feed you a line of xxxx so you will fall for it, i mean come on, religion already did that right>.....emoticonxbouncer
3413	1	a	<sarcasm mode on> it's sexual assault because when she sobered up and realized what she'd done, the little darling couldn't possibly have been responsible for her own actions.  <sarcasm mode off>
3414	1	a	where were you when we discussed this twice previously?  nice slur, good way to show your false 'compassion' emoticonxcry depends where it hits. two to the center and one to the head is the accepted protocol. i posted dr. fackler's, the leading authority on 'wounds', previously. did you miss it and the miami dade shooting events? scroll back dearie.
3415	1	a	i had expected better, so i'm mildly surprised to see this poster limbo gaily beneath the unspeakable basement standard set by his comrades in arms. emoticonxconfused
3416	1	a	oh yeah, all the most famous scientists, composers, writers, bands. all girls of course.... no, not really. yeah whitney huston, obviously way bigger than the rolling stones, beatles, who, led zeplin...... yeah great. take a step back, and read some good literature, you might learn something, un biased. opera the most powerful woman on earth> if she is, why will she die in the next 30-40 years, and how come i had never even heard of her until a little while back? how come, if she is so powerful, she is not out curing terminal diseases. oh i guess sitting on some leather sofa trying to get more ratings is way better!
3417	1	a	Sweetie, if every gay person were as wealthy as Mary Cheney, we could laugh all the way to the bank and ignore the prejudice in society the way she does. Indeed, we'd probably be the darlings of the GOP. Unfortunately for your delusion, gays are no more or less wealthy on average than anyone else.
3418	1	a	and neither did god write them. they were writen by men and there was no devine inspiration. there is no difference between the bible and margaret mitchell's gone with the wind. oh yes i am sorry gone with the wind at least gets history correct.
3419	1	a	jyoshu, for someone who is so sure of his opinions, i am surprised that you have chosen to ignore my challenge to you statement - (btw, inseparable is spelt with an 'a'. :) ) leo
3420	1	a	that sounds a lot like another species... what is it called... oh, right, humans! have no predators to fear? check. grown high in numbers? check. a danger to all other animals and humans alike? check. so, here's an easy way to curb the numbers... let's hunt them!
3421	1	a	i just love how you attempt to be mr. forum police here steve. if you want to be a moderator so bad why not apply? i'm certain this board could use the help. as far as your scenario it's rather laughable but whatever. point being is if people demand evidence why not give them that? i'd rather be an open honest man than hide behind a handle any day.
3422	1	a	violence, death, conflict, etc. yet god is the one who condones all that. in fact who considers most of it right. BEGIN QUOTE he doesn't care about what's right and not right. END QUOTE oh yeah, god really does not care about those at all. considering all that he regards as good (slavery, raping, killing children, etc.) BEGIN QUOTE he has no remorse for his actions.END QUOTE  it just gets better and better... BEGIN QUOTE sure, you don't have to worship him,  END QUOTE only an idiot would worship god. BEGIN QUOTE but i don't think he encourages people to grow and live their life the 'moral' way. END QUOTE this is so true. god is not moral, not even remotely close.
3423	1	a	yep. you got it.  i'm so busted.  seriously. you were a lot closer with the 'abusive participant' thing and i'm surprised that you (of all people) took the line that you did. cheap shots like that are not something that you are known for.
3424	1	a	really? damn! i wanna be awesome too. are you selling awesomeness or do i have to develop it on my own? if it's a lot of work, i might just settle on being mediocre.
3425	1	a	the aussies are banning publications and films of women with small breasts. if you think that mens mags like nuts are pornographic you are a little sad..dont mix with other men much..mother told you sex was dirty? oh dear the porn expert is insinuating that i must be getting my rocks off..see above:) graphic depictions of rape are freely available in videos and so are not 'rare'. expert on slasher films with 'teenage trollops getting killed...see above:)
3426	1	a	geeze, oldsarge, i'm sorry you missed the rabies shots when they were passing them out. i'm surprised to see you still around frothing at the mouth.
3427	1	a	'they give both sides of the isle a chance to talk.' oh yeah, us liberals are free to talk on fox...  we just aren't allowed to defend ourselves when our statements are taken out of context, correct you when you misquote or misread soemthing for the benefit of your stance on a topic, or have the last word.... other than that, we may speak....
3428	1	a	i love it when you bash people for stating opinions and no facts when you turn around and the same thing...i take it you have proof of a lie (keep in mind that lying is not the same as being wrong). as for hagel...i will assume he is actually in iraq right now and wrote that. give me a break emoticonxrolleyes
3429	1	a	honestly did not know that acorn was such an evil organization that was based on evil-ness.  but really acorn seems like a very good organization based on helping those in need of help. i was under the impression of something totally different. i guess don't believe what you hear on fox news =]
3430	1	a	wow, so you're saying that christianity should be able to stand the test of extreme scrutiny? are you trying to use this as an excuse to bash it time and again? great idea! i think you should spread the wealth a little! bash some hindus and buddhists and jews! oh, wait- no that is discrimination!!! you racist! i think that christianity has definitely should the test of extreme scrutiny long enough! millions of christians have been killed in history as martyrs.
3431	1	a	accountable by trial? by following the advice given to them? how about holding the advisors accountable? oh wait!! how about holding the people who put the advisors in power accountable? oh shit!!! hold the government accountable! hold the people who put government accountable. hold every citizen accountable. nice work, captain hindsight. you put yourself at trial. 'i shouldn't have acted like i know more about drilling for oil than oil companies'.
3432	1	a	i love how marc is just detached from reality. i doubt he'll reply to how he's so wrong about the cases he listed. two can't even be found on findlaw.
3433	1	a	oh really? then please provide me with several links that prove i'm an idiot or shut the fuck up! considering you only have 30 points i'm not too sure just how much you could possible know about anyone on this site? come on dude! you're a troll and everyone knows it... stop your trolling, grow up and hang with the big dogs... if you can't then close your fucking troll account and go bye bye.
3434	1	a	oh yes. that's why the brits took fast and sure measures to round up the islamofascist jerks. wish we could do the same here, oh yes, i almost forgot.we are!!
3435	1	a	what? don't they have boyfriends? i'm just amazed that they don't design all women shirts so that they come off easy. hell, they invented the easy access bra ;)
3436	1	a	oh but he/ she is. his often speaks out to remind our dear mps that they are supposed to be leaders of our country, not school kids a playground. he does this by yelling 'order!' a lot. and he gets to wear a silly wig i think (or is that 'black rod'?) (ps, wilted_laughter is irish i think. your post sort of implies you think him english. calling an irishman 'english' is a crime even more serious than calling someone a 'liberal' in the usa :p)
3437	1	a	i love it how no mention of bush can go long without the word nazi! emoticonxrolleyes
3438	1	a	oh yes liberal: anyone who disagrees with vor regardless of their political standing. you would call frist a liberal if he disagreed with you, hell you would even goldwater a liberal if he disagreed with you.  i'm going to mentally replace farfignewgin whenever you say liberal, after all, they have the same meaning in your context.  you can support the troops by disagreeing with any mission that is unncessary in terms of security and any mission that puts troops in unncessary danger. explain to me how you can support the troops by supporting a mission that doesn't help america and gets 1600 of them needlessly killed.
3439	1	a	no.. go read the bible before you look dumber than you already do. sorry dear, ad hominems do nothing. it sounds like you're talking about something you know little about. i apologize i sound that way. i certainly know what i am referring to in the bible, and knowing that you have admitted you don't necessarily follow the whole bible (god > bible) i figured i wouldn't assume you believed in genesis adam and eve. but rather give you the option to say yes or no.  god didn't want us to be puppets.  i didn't necessarily say puppets. he wanted us to have free will, to do what we wanted -and if they did love him, it should be their choice. if sin wasn't created, we would have been god's puppets. so god was performing some twisted reverse psychology on adam and eve?
3440	1	a	call it what you will - cry, whine, pout, 'put on notice', it's all the same to me. i wasn't trying to be profound that's for sure, apparently, you didn't see the humour either. :p i'm just really amused at how you've got your knickers in a bunch over the #%$# !@#$@ atheists that are coming to 'ruin' everything you cherish. :p the funniest thing, well there's two actually, one, you don't really have a leg to stand on legally despite your claims to the contrary, and two, the threat is mostly in your head. boo hoo. emoticonxcry  waxy
3441	1	a	why thank you , and yes i guessed that as you are pretty busy grovelling to the hide and seek champ , so full credit to you and of course the invisible dictator ..., don be shy take a bow .....
3442	1	a	i love how you are using violence to threaten people. when, your argument is disputing violence.
3443	1	a	fine lets just all be on our own, fuck government, fuck state, fuck town, fuck family, lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy. there has to be an order to things if not there will be chaos, history has proven this time and time again, but if you think that's the way to live be my guest, you will not live to long, the universe seeks balance and order not chaos. yes power will corrupt this is the reason for the system we have, like family, town, state, government and un to prevent the power hungry from taking over, it is up to us to prevent that from happening, we the people are the world not some lone wolf.
3444	1	a	see you know, lets all sign a petition to ban the doctor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you know prodigee was right all along!
3445	1	a	well, it's nice to know my assumption there was a dishonest ulterior motive (rather than actually wanting to discuss it) to the request was indeed correct. can't say i'm surprised though. this poster has consistently avoided actual discourse with most anyone with whom he'd find real disagreement (gasp!) for as long as i've known of him, usually choosing instead to throw his easy 'drive-by' insults from the peanut gallery. basically, he's a coward, and most anywhere else would probably be considered a troll.
3446	1	a	i do like written constitutions very much; and our constitution is not vague at all. in the first amendment, the question is not whether congress may make a law, but rather what is 'the freedom of the press?' this phrase has objective, historic meaning, and obscenity is not covered within that objective, historic meaning. neither, by the way, is the publishing of nuclear secrets. you have gathered incorrectly, for i do not want a direct democracy. how do you suppose we got 'civil rights' recognized in the constitution to begin with, matthew? did the words just magically appear there, or did a vast majority of people vote to put them there? oh yes, that's right, a vast majority of people voted to put them there. darn evil democracy! i say down with majority rule!
3447	1	a	i'm surprised he didn't google it. maybe that's too logical?
3448	1	a	i'm shocked! how could hunter mislead me so? emoticonxrolleyes given his previous output, i have to confess that i'm not at all surprised that this was a garbage in, garbage out moment. i feel slightly embarrassed at not stopping to consider the preposterous nature of a 14% figure though emoticonxembarrassed
3449	1	a	so the quickest way to get over 20,000 points is to not be serious? check!
3450	1	a	I can't believe that you would attempt to make such an insane assertion. Clearly, God was speaking about homosexual sex, but I'm not surprised that you left out the most unambiguous scriptural references. emoticonXRolleyes
3451	1	a	wow, thanks for admitting how you really feel about sex apparently. never given your so-called 'wife' an orgasm eh? i sure could...lol...
3452	1	a	wow, i don't understand how this keeps happening. i'll try to switch mice.
3453	1	a	And you have been refuted time after time. Lies, damn lies and statistics is a starting point. Its the false idea of the more powerless you render yourself the safer you will be. I bet you strongly believe its possible to pick up a turd by the clean end.
3454	1	a	uh...how does that work? oh yes, comming from the person who thinks a cd is good during times of low inflation, it does not suprise me you do not even understand the basics of taxation.
3455	1	a	then explain why the moon isn't burning, after all, it's significently larger then any known comet.  this is beyond ignorant. explain how something far smaller then the moon could sustain nuclear fusion for millions of years yet brown dwarfs which are larger then the moon can't.  coronal mass ejections are not even similar to comets. we have evidence of what comets are. spectrum analysis of light given off by vaporization tells us exactly what they are made of. given your comments, i'm not surprised that the scientific contributions of the islamic world over the past 50 years have essentially been nothing.
3456	1	a	that wasn't a reason why we fought hitler. in fact, if you will remember many in the states didn't believe that occured until they saw the pictures.  hardly a reason to invade. unless you'd like to flip it around and say that every country who's leader we tried to murder has the same right. emoticonxrolleyes  how is that our problem? oh yes, it's not.  as i recall, we kicked him out, beat him up, put him under sanctions and virtually removed any ability to do anything of revelance.  doesn't that mean we have to invade north korea? emoticonxrolleyes  that's been dealt with already. rehashed arguments are worthless.  huh. stalinist govermemnt. reminds me of the dictators the us put in power in latin america. :) the mass graves also was dealt with. but then again, you clearly do not understand the me culture.
3457	1	a	i love how the apple fan is illiterate. what exactly is the great thing that apple invented?
3458	1	a	that doesn't suprise me. again i'm not surprised that your first reaction to the idea that people aren't equal would be to enslave some and that your second idea would be to subjegate women. this reveals way too much about your nature. it ain't pretty. try living homeless for a year then get back to me on whether you saw yourself as equal to someone on '1million a year' emoticonxrolleyes now if the '1million a year' person gave the homeless person 1/2 million a year, then they would be equal, because equality is at the entre of such socialist ideals.
3459	1	a	are you planning to be dead by age 40? i dunno. do you start to sag by then? wow! are you serious? his death is far worse because he's a total hottie? of course! if channing tatum died tomorrow i would cry. it's a total let down!!
3460	1	a	oh dear, and your argument against me is not based on what i've said, but what kind of person you perceive me to be. ouch!
3461	1	a	more from unkerpaulie's list: 'world net daily' is a 'medical/scientific institution'????????????????????? from the website: unbiased??????????????????? really, unkerpaulie, i am surprised you didn't list fred phelps website in your 'medical/scientific institutions' list.
3462	1	a	he lives in arizona, a republican state. that explains everything.
3463	1	a	let's all listen to one religious book and base our laws off of that, regardless of any other beliefs that may exist, especially when regarding something that has little to no effect on anyone but those directly involved. that makes sense. lets all listen to one scientific theory and base our laws to teach that the earth is round. that doesn't make sense
3464	1	a	oh yeah, they made all that stuff up for people who believe in that ;)
3465	1	a	i love how you cling to hope that your god exists. dont you think its about time to stop the denials and face the facts? you actually believe that god has no time to help all of the starving people,  indeed. christianity are a fool for thinking that god is a good person
3466	1	a	so basically, what you are advocating here is that public schools should teach no moral values whatever. they shouldn't teach tolerance, because that offends the intolerant; they shouldn't teach racial equality, because that offends racists; they shouldn't teach religious freedom, because that offends religious bigots. maybe they shouldn't teach the immorality of theft and murder because that offends thieves and murderers.  i am truly surprised to hear a right-winger such as your good self advocating that public schools should promote a moral vacuum. but then, i suppose anything is better than teaching acceptance of gay families as just another sort of family among the many that exist today.
3467	1	a	what the? lmaorolf wow... easy i'm sorry but let me catch my breath... oh man you really are a card... if you couldn't tell my entire post was a joke you dimwitted nut job. always scrounging the bottom of the barrel for anything to use for ammo... did you stuff your brain in the cannon as well before you fired? and fyi i say hun to well almost all my friends as a joke... they know i'm gay but not flaming by any means and they get a kick out of it so lighten up and get the crucifix out of your hand and put it back on the wall alright?
3468	1	a	uncalled for, my nationality doesn't have much relevance to this, but nah you can go on pretending you're the only country in the world and shoot yourselves to hell, it's about what i'd expect. you see i hear something like the school massacre in europe, i am shocked, but in the usa it's a regular occurrence! but nah, you keep your guns if they make you happy, go play with your boom booms. i know 18 kids who won't have a happy christmas!
3469	1	a	if i were a virgin it wouldn't insult me that you called me such a meaningless terminology. ignoring that nonsensical 'insult', i shall simply call you a man-whore and move along. as for the answer to the question, i will ask you why you try so hard to contribute constructively to a website that rewards you with nothing. oh dear, man-whore, that 'virgin' just burst your ego, what will you ever do?
3470	1	a	you're joking, right?!?!?! you really believe books, teachers, computers, etc. are more important than a hungry child whose parents cannot afford to pay? wow...
3471	1	a	hey i just aked a question ....... you think im evil , how would your mum have felt reading half the shit that comes out of your mouth. pfht fuck you darling. oh and i love you.
3472	1	a	i think you underestimate the intelligence of a 6 year old and what they can comprehend............... and that 6 year old is not only the people but the future which makes it even more imperative that he or she know the sacrafices others have made to make this country the great country it is........ i am not surprised you call it brainwashing though....... emoticonxrolleyes
3473	1	a	You betcha. Even JP who usually can defend such stuff has failed. VOR doesn't even bother (not surpisingly consider it requires brain usage)   The mere fact they let him do that is damning aganist the Vatican.
3474	1	a	do you know what a marriage is under the law? oh yeah, that's right, a legal union. they are the exact same thing just with different names, its like if i had two identical roses and called them joe and sam, they're still both the same rose.
3475	1	a	i am amused by how some people can look at an article of an anti-gay marriage advocate attacking a gay marriage advocate, and the person reading the article wants to focus on what qualifies as 'oppression' and how gays could have it worse... emoticonxdonno  just out of curiousity, do you have any comment as to whether or not the attack was wrong?
3476	1	a	oh really? anybody can say that they are a always a guest on here and then all of a sudden come . nice try for an excuse.
3477	1	a	you don't know? oh yeah... you're supposedly married to that teenager, prodigee.
3478	1	a	if the federal government wants to pay for it, fine. the federal government has no business telling private insurance companies how to run their business. especially if they have religious ties. i'm surprised anyone wanted to put their dick inside your rotted out pussy.
3479	1	a	since we're at war with radical islam and they have attacked our homeland once already and have promised a repeat performance. it is ludicrous, irresponsible and suicidal to consider that investigating people of islamic descent before allowing them entry to be a discriminatory policy. especially since terrorists don't fight like men but are committed only to hit and die/run sneak attacks. but i'm not surprised that you're blinded by political correctness when you should be concerned about your families security. emoticonxrolleyes
3480	1	a	lmao seriously i rarely show emotion, but that's funny. 1. how does that compare to 9/11 exactly? 2. at least that guy was aprehended, where's osama again? oh yeah that's right, we were busy in a random country in the mid-east because some president's daddy was there and jr wanted to show how cool he was. bush should have stuck to bankrupting professional baseball teams and oil companies. and conservatives have no leg left to stand on... literally your pirate avatar is fitting as insulting as you would wish it were. take out your peg leg and try to stand on an issue. current republicans = bought and owned by private interest. those sad soles defending it = easily persuaded and uneducated. i know because i'm an elite liberal. i regularly laugh at how dumb you are.
3481	1	a	i'm shocked that people side with illogical arguments rather than logic.
3482	1	a	wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. finally you are cheering for the correct side. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again. it is funny how many of you religious people are so sure of your faith, but can't stand to see other people talk about how observable data doesn't fit with it.
3483	1	a	are you talking about this one??? he was talking about 'god'. he never said your 'god'. and i am both amused and bored by the fact that i just explained to you how evolution and a belief in a creator can co-exist, and you completely ignored it. but you're going to continue to claim that they are mutually exclusive, won't you...
3484	1	a	oh yeah, but its okay to say that george bush is a criminal is it? no one wants to be fair then do they, lets be fair only when a democrat gets in trouble!
3485	1	a	i love when random myth followers talk about critical thinking :d
3486	1	a	wow, thats some poetic shit. i wonder to you roam around disagree with the people who boost about americas greatest, or how their a force for good. i wonder to you post wise ass comments next to these people. you have no idea how much of a hippocrit you are do you.
3487	1	a	woohoohoo, diogenes, talk about twisting my statements, wow! wow! i am just plain flabbergasted!
3488	1	a	i'm doomed. yes, i love lobster, shrimp and even the impure oyster and other mollusks, i may be innocent of wearing linen and wool together but i can't be sure!!! doomed!!! oh, dear god, i'm doomed!!!!!
3489	1	a	what is not only illogical but patently false is the assertion that the unborn baby is making his mother a slave of any kind. did that baby force her to conceive it? is that baby the equivalent of a tumor as the pro abortionists claim them to be? no, it is an unborn human being who just needs the time to grow and develop in order to be a sentient being just as we are as we type on these keyboards.  that explains everything about how irrational you are! but based on your posts though, i think they already pulled the plug. emoticonxfrazzledemoticonxdonno
3490	1	a	i love how what you 'personally' feel is in direct conflict with acedemic studies. science says force = mass times acceleration, but i personally feel that force = velocity times volume, so that must be the right answer.
3491	1	a	dear lisa, i want to tell you you're hot. hot as in every way possible. in fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. the way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: if you'll remove that top button i would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. do you like warts? i hope so. there's this longing
3492	1	a	oh yeah..., my fiends did that for me. they had an intervention and they vented. they were pissed me for mercilessly trolling them and it worked. i am now a kinder, gentler, troll ;)
3493	1	a	let's see if i understand you correctly, because i think you may be on to something incredibly insightful. let's see, the island with males and females, uh, can reproduce, and, ... uh,  eureka, i've got it!!! you need a male and female to sexually reproduce!!!! that's ingenious!!!! you're brilliant, cool spot!! you're forgetting one thing. the island without the gay guys would not be nearly as fabulous.
3494	1	a	wow, these are some very nice values, lets teach them to everyone else! if the bible says so, why not? you seem determined to debate about a book of flawed values. are you sure you are defending this book of it's values? because surely you must have some kind of religious point of view to even think of protecting a piece of old literature.
3495	1	a	and bill clinton didn't? obama doesn't? emoticonxdonno let me help you with that. emoticonxangel she's a conservative! i'll bet her upcoming debate with biden will get far more attention than mccain/obama did! i'll sure be watching! word has it that the moderator is an obama lover.  i'm just surprised that so many consider it so important how one performs in these quick witted, personality contests. just because a person is slightly off the mark in wits doesn't mean he/she would not be a good leader - able to make sound political decisions.  looks aside, pelosi's a dingbat compared to palin. she gets a free pass from the news media - ho hum.
3496	1	a	btw, jazyjason, before you edited out your complimentary comment about howard dean. just wanted to say i'm surprised you said anything to associate yourself thus with a such an irrational far left commie. must stay with the mudflingers and lynch mobs and, especially if they're jesus lovers, ya know. so ... i understand why you took it down. merry christmas.
3497	1	a	he is. it is like i sin a few times now i am a satanist. i was not aware that i could not have an opinon without being a satanist. you have been a christian longer: does god hate lying lips?
3498	1	a	wowie! well shut my mouth and watch me wilt!!! lmao. 50times50
3499	1	a	i disagree with it because there is no god. these are your words: 'i propose that a standard of good or evil cannot be defined by humans or human constructs.' i guess i shouldnt be surprised that i cant get a straight answer. you dont know. i am surprised your 'god' has not provided you with more adaquate ansures.
3500	1	a	go back to the part in which we were discussing a specific case and stop trying to encompass the universe in your justification. (you know there are mothers in bokoboko that don't have enough lizard eggs to feed their babies so they eat them)emoticonxbanghead  i'm not surprised that a moral definition of selfish disgusts you. splat! :)
3501	1	a	i'm surprised no one has unearthed some stickman figures and announced that the drawings of jesus have been discovered, as recorded in john 8:7, where he's doodling on the ground while some poor young woman is about to get pelted with rocks. what a pilgrimage that would make...
3502	1	a	be homophobic... like the naacp? oh wait, they're left wing. call for war... like the democrats for vietnam? oh wait, they're left wing. be racist... like claim that minorities can't help themselves? oh wait, that's also left wing. sir... you've engaged in stereotyping... that makes you... hmm.
3503	1	a	i love it when the left dogs beck but blatantly shows their bias by not covering news stories detrimental to our pot-earred president. ;)
3504	1	a	agreed, and they are really grasping at straws now. i'm surprised that anyone still takes kennedy seriously. emoticonxrolleyes
3505	1	a	according to what you mentioned previously, you violated the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy and came out of the closet, disrupting your unit. real classy, jazy. your gay sex sin took preference over honorable service. but then that's your idol, so i'm not surprised.
3506	1	a	you're kidding. just because your life is 'a fricken breeze' that doesn't mean the other 7 billion people on this earth have a breezy life. have you even watched the news lately? it's either that, or you live on another planet.
3507	1	a	then why have you attacked kerry and other democrats for voting aganist abortion bills that did not have such clauses?  oh yes, i know why, because you're a lying hypocrite.
3508	1	a	in that case its a single act of terroism so if you know all of this what's the name of his group? i wasn't on a high horse. also could you post the source saying he was part of some group and not just a loon.  jeez that sucks. *shrugs* well no different from black leaders who were targeted, slave owners/abolitionists who were targeted. this happens all the time. i'm surprised it hasn't happened earlier. i love how its a conspiracy! *roll eyes* its terrorism not a conspiracy. unless you gonna tell me the governments in on it. xd
3509	1	a	i love how you cons cry race card when someone points out obvious racism.
3510	1	a	Plain with the benefit of hindsight. I love how you're able to determine, not having been there, precisely what was said and precisely where it fell in relation to the law. If it was so clear, we'll see the prosecution for wrongful arrest in due course, I'm sure.
3511	1	a	not really dearie, you're just ssdd. you're not unique or even all that intellegent. you just follow the crowd because you haven't an original thought in your head. but that's ok, we don't blame you, per se, we know you can't control your behavior. emoticonxrolleyes
3512	1	a	well, there ya go! that explains everything gansao, we have been sincerely debating a serious issue of human development with a simpleton who gets his education from fictional tv. now i understand completely why it has been impossible to reason with him. we are officially wasting our time even communicating with such a person. emoticonxwow emoticonxdonno emoticonxfrazzled
3513	1	a	i love how scumbarge doesn't give a rebuttal to this. he knows you have him by the balls.
3514	1	a	i love how you claim that the teabag party is not affiliated with the republicans, who are they going to vote with ?.. the democrats?.. they may not claim to be republicans but last i checked we only have two major parties representing us in the house and senate, with maybe one or two independents.the tea bag party isn't big enough to control anything without republicans so enlighten me, who are they going to vote with to destroy what obama has accomplished so far?...
3515	1	a	oh yeah? you can't out-post me! i type about 20 wpm. i still look at the keyboard when i type... which means, ultra-focus! i can switch between my right index finger and my left index finger. i'm a posting machine... try me.
3516	1	a	so your saying dr. tiggerroo, that my parents decided i would be gay for me. fascinating. do you have any other amazing rubbish to spit out of your mouth. i am captivated by your amazing intelligence on this subject. it sound like you have been studying this all through kindergarden. grow up, get a clue.
3517	1	a	oh yes, that time when you were on two ships at the same time in different oceans? or how about when you were a mid level naval officer who suddenly became a high level army advisor to the south vietnamese?  you're lying.
3518	1	a	wow a down-vote and no dispute, thanks kozlov (edit: or not kozlov?).
3519	1	a	wow, you have a g.e.d. what happened? dropped out of high school? or did you flunk out? judging by you sentences (if you can call them that), you flunked out. and as for me, i have a computer engineering associates degree and i'm working towards my bachelors of science in computer engineering, so keep that in mind. i suppose the 'really important things' that you are learning that aren't reading and writing is how to roll a joint or take lsd since i couldn't imagine what a person who still lives in his mom's basement learns.
3520	1	a	good grief... satanist?!.. my goodness how can you say such a thing?!  i will have to ban you for even mentioning the concept of it! my dear old fellow!
3521	1	a	oh, i agree with you...oh wait, did a clarify argument show up in the argument listing? damn! i think it did!
3522	1	a	oh yeah so our tax dollars pay for there asses to live in our prisons? no thanks our tax dollars are the ones feeding and bedding there asses
3523	1	a	i just love how deliciously ironic this statement here is. well done.
3524	1	a	'wow my life my life is already turning out better then yours' what do you mean your life is turning out well? you live with your parents. you have no responsibilities, accomplishments, or qualifications for anything as you are 15. you are not even old enough to get a job, what are you talking about? ah i see you are related to jakej. i can't say i am surprised.
3525	1	a	fine lets just all be on our own, fuck government, fuck state, fuck town, fuck family, lets all do what we feel so long as it makes us happy. that is you doing the same damn thing, hypocrite.
3526	1	a	wow, good response. you know, attacking foul language instead of making a proper rebuttal makes you sound as uneducated and immature as you apparently are.
3527	1	a	reckon if a rock could think it would have a concept or two.
3528	1	a	yes secular governments work. nor does it take much to see the philosophical similarities, as pointed out by trebor, between a religion, such as christianity or islam and communism, socialism, capitalism, totalitarism or a monarchy, but it does require an additional step, hence my comment of 2+2+2.  but just for kicks, let's say i am fully on board with communism as a religion and am now jumping ship on the idea. this would be the only reason you can give, other than what you have misunderstood which is explained abvove, that makes the study flawed. which doesn't take a genius to grasp makes no sense whatsover. so take your time, think about it, because there is an argument to made for your view and i am surprised nobody picked up on it, but let's see if you can figure it out on your own.
3529	1	a	well geeze pyg...i knew you were a bit itchy but i didn't know you hated gay people! i also didn't know you owned the 'internetz!' you must be related to al gore...how much did he soak you for his invention, lol? i don't know if you realized it but i'm gay too. yes indeedy little pyggy, shall i go back from whence i came or am i safe here with you? you seem to know what a 'rick roll' is so i'm impressed...'cause i've never heard the term.
3530	1	a	i love it how you every time someone disagrees with you, you call it 'attacking' :|
3531	1	a	i love how you managed to make a counter-troll sound like a serious reply :)
3532	1	a	of course it crossed my mind, but logic isn't allowed; this is religion. jesus isn't showing up or walking away from their bread munching wine drinking rituals. i am supposed to be surprised that jesus supposedly said just one more thing which makes no sense what so ever? the early church wasn't called catholic because there were no other protestants running around to differentiate between. if imagination alone could generate heaven, you would be right. i have no reason to believe heaven exists. which are based on the beliefs of the early church, which you have already admitted existed during jesus's life time.
3533	1	a	'slaves, tortures, drones, dictators' hmm, what does that sound like? oh yeah, the history of most european countries, including germany.
3534	1	a	oh really, a combination of the words expel and arm mean to expel arms? wow, she was a creative genius! i think what he meant was rowling just takes all the stereotypical magicy stuff and mashes it all together into a tacky and overused paste.
3535	1	a	i love how you are pro-choice until its a choice you don't like. let people carry guns in their own home. let them carry it on their person. it has nothing to do with you does it not? unless you deal with people threatening you with guns on a daily basis it doesn't. their house =/= their choice, her body = her choice?  i love hypocrisy.
3536	1	a	wowwwwwwwww. you learned how to say something other than 'you are going to hell'. did your mother teach you that, or are you just copying what i'm doing? cuz i doubt you are smart enough to learn anything by yourself.
3537	1	a	which post do you think most accurately demonstrates archie's ethics? is it the one(s) where he denigrates gays? the one(s) where he accuses those who disagree with him of being filthy, rotten liars, but is incapable of providing an example of their dishonesty? maybe it's the one(s) where he goes off on an insult laden rant that manages to break damn near every point of the tos? since i've just listed pretty much all of his posts, which one demonstrates archie's impeccable ethics the best? seeing as how you just accused a perfect stranger of having no ethics, simply because he disagreed with you, i'm not surprised you feel a kinship with archie.
3538	1	a	i love how iranian president alphabets kidnaps 15 sailors and marines, holds them captive on bs evidence, and then trys to act like the biggest humanitarian on earth by 'pardoning' them out of the kindness of his heart. personally, i think it would be nice for these 15 british troops to see the bombers going the opposite direction as they leave iranian airspace.
3539	1	a	i'm surprised archangel hasn't jumped on this.  he's gullible enough to fall for tv props, why not this?
3540	1	a	oh really? then why don't we go naked and live in a forest or jungle? ................ i did not mean to say that i say we are different but the same.
3541	1	a	i am surprised that you were able to give a non troll answer.
3542	1	a	i'm a communist and i like pie emoticonxdonno how dare you. i'm almost offended but am so intrigued by your avatar that i get a happy feeling inside and forget about it. but please, next time, please consider the communists when using them as an insult. emoticonxgood *although this post is mostly sarcastic, i am being a little bit serious.
3543	1	a	i guess since your know how to post without the 50 characters you are a half veteran but once you figure out behind what's behind the humor of joe's post you will be a full veteran. pay attention.
3544	1	a	i am impressed you are impressed by that backward-minded bigot who's main insight was a mere claim without justification on any form of harm to the institution of marriage and said, 'fuck the fags'? come on dude.
3545	1	a	wow many false gods beat an actual one. christinity may only believe in one god, the god.
3546	1	a	wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again.
3547	1	a	Oh, yea. You are damn right those European socialists are dangerous. Americans might look and see their governments actually doing something USEFUL for the people and think that we should have that here.  I am surprised we have not nuked them yet.
3548	1	a	FILTER BY LACK OF ENGLISH WORDS. oh yeah..???????? emotion is juz lyk the engine vch pulls da coaches n help'em 2 reach 2 der destinantion as da coaches've no destination 2 move or 2 b pulled....da same way, if der's no emotion how da hell man can accomplish his goal nd destination......my dear competent frnd.....most probably u've forgotten da 'v r human beings'.
3549	1	a	the nice part. i'm surprised that you've even read the bible. presumably you're commenting on 1 thessalonians 5:2, wherein paul admonishes the greeks to be watchful for the coming of god? the funny thing is that all of my bibles say that.
3550	1	a	you don't see me making similar knee-jerk reactions. woopdee fucking doo. but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with. well done darling. but being an american you should know that in marriage people choose who they spend the next couple of years with not the rest of their lives. now let's get back to the facts - where in an arranged marriage does it say the 2 people getting arranged don't have a choice?
3551	0	a	dear, as i have already said that rape is committed by persons of imbalance minds/or intoxicated persons. so, logically they can't exercise self control (and that's y we call them mentally imbalanced). i agree , that if a woman says no, it means no. but , in that state of mind a man can't understand that she is denying, what a rapist thinks is only his sexual gratification. and that's y its a crime . and we have punishments for it.. thank you for ur time. and i appreciate ur views..
3552	0	a	ez, can you cite an actual case where the aclu has intervened on behalf of nambla? the only person or persons with close associations to nambla that i can bring to mind is the notorious father paul r. shanley who molested countless children and was carefully sheltered under the wing of the notorious his eminence bernard francis cardinal law who was finally ousted from his cardinalship by a multitude of angry roman catholic parishioners in the boston area. dear his eminence bernard francis cardinal law was immediately taken and sheltered under the wing of the vatican and scooted over the pond to several administrative posts of the roman curia, where he was also named as archpriest of the basilica di santa maria maggiore, one of the five major basilicas of the roman catholic church.
3553	0	a	that's just darling, and all. but it still doesn't indicate that a fetus is a small person. no one denies it's alive. no one denies it is of the species homo sapiens. no one denies that an embryo can ultimately become as person, which is the simplistic point of that cloying article. it is personhood of the fetus that is the debate. i don't think it can ever be definitively determined.  using dr. seuss was an excellent choice of reference to back your argument, however. i am not sure why you quoted shooter's post about a death sentence. however, if you really equate abortion with murder, are you willing to advocate charging the mother and doctor with premeditated murder?
3554	0	a	oh really? i prove evidence to the subject and i don't repeat the same thing over and over again. i am not repeating anything over and over am i. i think you are the worst debator.
3555	0	a	oh really? this isnt cyber bullying. this is barely slander. you arent returning fire. this is stupid. freedom of speech isnt a two way street. you have restrictions. both legal and moral. what the hell is going on?
3556	0	a	oh yeah, i went to see the new movie a couple of weeks ago, it's probably the most interesting film i have seen in a long time. i actually bought the book because of the movie and i am going to read it sometime in the near future. looking forward to it!
3557	0	a	okay, i guess i'll have to watch the new batman movies soon. what did you think of the opening scene to x2? with nightcrawler trying to assassinate the president? one of my favorite scenes from any movie. yeah, each spider-man movie was worse. last i heard, they are planning a complete reboot without tobey or raimi.
3558	0	a	we do! on npr (which is our national public radio) they play the bbc world news daily. it is a fantastic source, i must agree.
3559	0	a	obama has 1 thing that palin certainly doesn't have is the fantastic ability to turn crowds in favor of him. obama has amazing speech abilities that surpasses palin without a doubt in my mind. palin also likes to go off subject almost as if she is avoiding certain questions.  what is experience if you cannot even thoroughly explain your position?
3560	0	a	final, switzerland 1 spain 0. spain, one of the favorites or perhaps the favorite to win the world cup, loses to switzerland. what a shocker. of course with two more matches for all teams in this group anything can happen, but the pressure is on spain. they can not afford to lose another game, even a tie could mean not getting to the round of sixteen.emoticonxwow
3561	0	a	wow, it's really rare to see someone admit to changing their mind about an issue. definitely deserves an upvote.
3562	0	a	my dear, i can see the wood for the trees. no-one expects perfect parents, but no parent should dictate school policy. and this guy was a bad example.

3564	0	a	the argument has nothing to do with whether the bible is true or not, and everything to do with how certain concepts and interpretations are deduced from reading a piece of literature. i'm not arguing that i believe in a rapture, but rather that there is biblical support for a rapture event. i hope you see the difference
3565	0	a	i think that's an excellent question. since my area of expertise is chemistry and not climatology, i can only speculate that it's a combination of peer pressure, the desire to get funding and their allowing governments to manipulate their findings.  there have been several instances in which members of the ipcc have quit amidst claims that the final reports issued did not reflect their research. since the final ipcc reports are reviewed by politicians prior to being published, i'm not surprised with the claims made. here's a relevent story.
3566	0	a	i love how you broke that down, but why would anyone who feels content in their life, by into something that's telling them they are wrong? it seems like they are cutting out a big portion of their market with a certain sin that harms no one.
3567	0	a	i am surprised that you would agree with the president of a group that says it promotes ' individual liberties to counter the radical right. '
3568	0	a	proof? and, i'm just surprised that brooks is actually capable of seeing where the problem lies. his solution? probably another dumb republican non-solution.

3570	0	a	...and half right. preventing something that has been predicted does not create a paradox. your logic is severely flawed here. i'm somewhat surprised by that. if i predict that georgia tech will win the peach bowl and lsu comes up and prevents that, i still predicted it. i was just wrong. you are attaching something supernatural to nostradamus as if he really had some power to accurately predict the future. he made some lucky guesses...that's all. sometimes, the local fortune cookies are right, too. sometimes the horoscopes seem to fit. that doesn't mean that the writer's actually knew anything about their future readers.

3572	0	a	wikipedia is really quite amazing actually. you see the fact that anybody can modify it as a reason to not trust it. that would be a valid concern if it had only a small number of contributors. but, there are millions of contributors. each going over and correcting information supplied by others. in my mind (given the current number of users) wikipedia is a fantastic peer-reviewed source of information.
3573	0	a	i don't :( tell me, inbox me if you don't want to say it in front of other's.  i am surprised i thought you would be to holy to have lust.
3574	0	a	insult? i'm not sure if you're joking or just have a bad memory. but you have been making false assumptions 'aka' insulting me also. i'm not trying to insult you. i'm simply dishing out just like you are buddy. and i don't have to back up anything to a stranger i'll never meet. i know how successful i am and what degrees i have. all these false assumptions you're coming up with aren't phasing me at all. stop dishing out if you cant take it.
3575	0	a	that explains why your politician can work together i bet your current government is made of a collation ? in the uk parliament we still have a first past the post system where the party with the majority form the government.  it is slightly different in scotland we have a hybrid system of pr and first past the post, the politics in scotland has changed slightly in fact the executive is made up of a collation between two parties. this has the effect of making our politics more consensual where parties can actually discuss and negotiation solutions without party politics and vote scoring.
3576	0	a	having been raised in texas as a child and teen, with many relatives still residing there, i'm surprised their educational system hasn't gone to the bible as its primary textbook. perhaps things have changed, but fundamentalist hypocrisy was at one time the law of the land in texas. maybe since texans are no longer served by oklahoma and louisiana bootleggers the fire and brimstone circuit has relaxed, but i'd find that difficult to believe as religion is a very effective control technique.
3577	0	a	libertarianism emphasises freedom of the individual, and limited government. a stereotypical libertarian view would be for the legalisation of prostitution. that's why i am surprised.

3580	0	a	dear chloe, do you really want women tried for murder because they decide to take a pill that will cause an abortion? that is the only logical position a court can take once a zygote, embryo and fetus are legislated into the status of human beings. if one kills a human being, one is guilty of murder.
3581	0	a	i think so too. every father should have a right to have a say when it comes to an abortion because that fetus was formed from their chromosomes and genetics. i am surprised that advocates for abortion are saying that men have no right to tell a woman how to control her body but yet they don't have a problem with the decision of the u.s supreme court in which all of the judges were men.
3582	0	a	i'm a little surprised- i've found that pot smokers are usually the least pushy. usually they're laid back enough to just offer, unless they forget to offer. i've only ever been pressured to drink by one person, and that's all the peer pressure i've received. i'm not sure if it's the people i hang with, who almost all use something but are very laid back, or if it's that i'd be hard to ressure so that people don't try. what's your experience been?

3585	0	a	Oh deary me, no. Where do I even start?The bacteria and enzymes in your gut and intestinal tract that digest food are every bit as microscopic, and they thrive on specific compounds, not elements. Sugars and fats are plain old carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. You could get exactly the same atoms into your body by drinking water and eating graphite - and you'd die. Can you digest cellulose? No - but other animals can, because they have enzymes that can break it down. It's still all just carbon, oxygen and hydrogen - but that's like saying everybody's front door key is just 'brass'. It isn't the fact that it's brass that unlocks your door, it's the shape it's formed into :)
3586	0	a	well, i own a new testament (only the new) book myself. so i am really surprised that you haven't seen one before.. but whatever. what i am saying, and what random dude seem to not get, is that christianity is based on the new testament. we believe in both books.. but when people ask, what is a christian? a christian is a person who believes in jesus - jesus only exist in the new testament - therefore if the new testament didn't exist, then christianity wouldn't exist either. so that is why christianity is based (remember the word based) on the gospels.
3587	0	a	unkerpaulie, thank you for this explanation. boing! eureka! i have finally concretely grasped what a 'strawman' argument is. creating something that does not exist. making mock, in a sense. sorry, i just have to reiterate the term in my terms to paste it firmly into place in my cranium.
3588	0	a	i was awake, just not on at the time you posted this. high school starts waaaayyy to early. anyway, i'm surprised at how many people post while i'm asleep (around 11:30 - 5:30 est)
3589	0	a	oh yeah, i don't disagree. i'm a massive fan of hitchens, and 99% of everything he said was true. he just happened to be, as you say, misguided on certain issues.
3590	0	a	you're joking right? that's not even close. here's the verse just in case you read something else, i'll give you the benefit of the doubt with that: 1 corinthians 13:3: if i give away all i have, and if i deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, i gain nothing. this does not mean 'but not loved for it', but showing love.
3591	0	a	oh really xaeon? netherlands has had prostitution legal for years and they are one of the most primary destinations for humans being trafficked. europe has many countries who have legalized prostitution but suffer from increased human trafficking. but maybe the us is different?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_the_netherlands  with it legalised more people are having sex with whores, and as soon as a whore is infected she doesn't even know it yet, so if she gets infected with hiv she still has sex with customers up until the day her next 'check up' is which is usually once a week. what happens to the infected prostitute? she gets kicked out onto the street. so thats one more woman infected, and possible many more men.
3592	0	a	a drink. a drink. one or two. and what the hell does abstinence have to do with this? everything in moderation, yeah yeah. all that fun stuff. i get it. i wasn't talking about light drinking. i guess i should clarify but i thought you'd catch what i meant.
3593	0	a	anyone who serves in the military is a hero. once you sign on the dotted line and take that oath, you are allowing for the possibility for death by combat at anytime. perhaps others didn't get the recognition she got, but that's not her fault. the media needed a 'darling of enduring freedom' poster child and she got picked.
3594	0	a	i'm pro-choice because when i get pregnant, i want to chose whether or not i will abort it. i am not pro-abortion because i don't want to be forced to aborting my child when i get pregnant i am not pro-life, because i don't want to be forced to have my child when i get pregnant. i am pro-choice, do not call me pro-abortion, because that is not what i am. i don't go on the streets and say ''hey, let's all have abortions'' you on the other hand go on and say ''hey let's give all fetuses life'' that's what makes you pro-life. i don't want abortion. i wish no one would chose it because it would be much better without it. but the world isn't ideal. don't change the title, i just want people to know that we are called pro-choicers.
3595	0	a	correct, of all the freedoms most dear is the right to be left to **** alone.
3596	0	a	14 or 12... that is a ridiculous statement. drinking can affect the brain growth, and it goes through it most radical transformation at that age. oh yeah let's all stuff up the new generations brains and crap.. smart idea. if they were able to dink legally at that age it would encourage more to drink. many around that age aren't able to find alcohol really. it would make the situation worse than making it better.. the increase of binge drinking would also increase, it is at where it now because usually a person of that age, if they are able, cannot acquire a high amount of alcohol.
3597	0	a	Oh dear, you're back to your nasty ad hominem self. I could have made fun of the fact that you don't know about materialism, and how its a major force behind evolution. Which is itself a suggestion that you are unaware of the socio-political forces driving western evolutionary theory.**The issue is about people behind sciences, making many different 'sciences'; based on bias, cultural/political/historical. 'Peer' doesn't mean anything because 'peers' are just people with the same background/bias etc.I notice you didn't touch upon Nationalist Sciences. Or for that matter, Capitalist Science.*You mean 'understanding' written English.**I say 'western' because there are other evolutionary theories - Marxist, Nazi, Feminist etc.Thank you, come again.
3598	0	a	oh yes this is all over the news in ireland. irish farmers are having a canary that its the end of ireland's sugar industry. and cereal too because of crop rotation. nobody seems to have even thought of the question as to why exactly the eu should pay for an unsustainable industry as oppossed to farmers moving into something profitable. edit: oh and its tied into something about sugar being one of irelands few natural resources. emoticonxbanghead
3599	0	a	fine. thank you.  what im hearing is that you believe attila should act in accordance with the prevailing moral consensus. how do you define the moral consensus? in attilas case, would that be among the huns? among the hun ruling elite? or should attila act in accordance with a wider consensus of which he (for the sake of argument) has no intimate knowledge?  now why should he act in accordance with the consensus?  this is not completely clear to me. so, do you take the position that moral sentiments are learned?
3600	0	a	i'm surprised that some people still aren't aware of what the chinese have done to upgrade their country. sure, certain areas like the financial sector are still lagging (which is why they won't float the yuan just yet), but when it comes to industry and infrastructure they're done a most admirable job. does anybody here also think it's kinda funny that a communist country is beating the us at their own game (i.e. capitalism)?
3601	0	a	i love how the creator is also just like, sure whatever .
3602	0	a	dear terry here, please see my post on the other side of this debate. you may think that nothing happens after you argue a debate, but that is just the start. so much more happens after a debate is created and argued. people around the world look at the debates and learn from them, make decisions because of them and create additional debates. your input can change the world. andy

3604	0	a	honestly, i am amazed, so there are actually gay people with a sense of reason. i have spent years of facing discrimination from narrow minded homosexual activists and all these years later, you are the only one that has ever demonstrated somewhat of a sense of reason beyond the same old hogwash i have seen demonstrated by thousands i have interacted with. i still have my reservations towards suspecting that somehow you might be attempting to set me up for a slam.
3605	0	a	reminds me of the cold war clamor of necessary 'defense' nuclear weapon parity with russia. considering the threats we make directed towards iran and others along with our occupation of iraq, i'm surprised our conceit hasn't made all of me and asia scramble for nukes. pakistan, 97% muslim, hides bin laden, governed by a general constantly avoiding assassination attempts, never a bad word about that us 'ally'. but they have nukes and delivery systems. i'd think iran believes, as we've shown, that the us doesn't spew the democracy at the point of a gun policy to those nations possessing nuclear weapons.

3608	0	a	simone darling, please stop. your making yourself look foolish. your trying to compare uniformed soldiers in an organized military under civilian gov't control to terrorists. there is no comparison to be made here, even you should be able to see that. huh? the u.s. military dismantled some of our bases in saudi arabia based on a prearranged schedule at the behest of the saudi government. it had nothing to do with 'capitulating to the taliban', nor did we remove all of our bases. yes simone, we still have military bases in saudi arabia.
3609	0	a	i agree with you dear... good reply of question... :)
3610	0	a	this is why i'm tempted to say the us deserves to fail. this isn't a game. don't any of you ###### understand that the time for 'us vs them' is long gone? 'your' guy is not a god, and 'their' guy is not the devil. the whole divisive nature of the us is absolutely incredible. i'm sure i'm not alone when i look on in dumbfounded disbelief at some of the posts on here. you're nation is crumbling, and rather than trying to figure out the best way to save it, some are not-so-secretly hoping the government fails so they can say 'i told you so!' others seem to think as long as they insult the 'other team' enough, everthing will be a-ok. un-believable...
3611	0	a	winston dearie you really shouldn't make such general accusations, that can get you into trouble. point them out if you can. the shooting in norway, columbine, virginia tech, the tulsa shootings and the tuscon assassination attempt weren't carried out by people a normal person could consider decent and respectable in nature and they were all massacres. you might kill somebody too. you might kill a lot of somebodies for no reason. should you be legislated against and restrained?
3612	0	a	i'm nothing if not a thoughtful atheist, but it's not skepticism that drove me from religion, but revulsion, and i absolutely refuse to let fear, the lowest of emotions and religions favorite trump card, to have any sway over my life when it comes to determining my religious beliefs. fear of judgement day is just one more trick religion has to get us to submit, and while i'm not surprised it worked to control illiterate savages and barbarians thousands of years past, i'm astounded so many people in this day an age allow themselves to fall prey to pascals wager.
3613	0	a	i can't vouch for what others believe. the creeds are a pretty accurate summary of my beliefs as regards who and what god is. the apostles' creed is the statement of belief used at baptism in most of christianity, so it would be strange for someone to have been baptised (or confirmed if they were baptised as an infant) without believing this to be true. to be honest i'm surprised by the idea that people (outside the pseudo-christian sects like the mormons and jehovah's witnesses) who claim to be christians would not believe what is stated in the creeds, it's not something that really occurred to me. i know that some people misunderstand the use of the word catholic in the last paragraph but that's about it.
3614	0	a	i'm surprised that 'the sixth sense' didn't make anyone's list. the twist at the end totally caught me off guard and blew me away. i also like forest gump, slingblade, platoon, top gun, the wizard of oz, shawshank redemption. there are more but it's monday.... :p
3615	0	a	his lies, his media darling status, my post above answers your question for you.
3616	0	a	i'm not sure how quotes from the other side of the same capitalist, warmongering coin as the republicans has any bearing on any church's support for war. the catholic church, and the us national council of churches (representing most protestant churches) opposed the war. the only church that was apparently in favour were the southern baptists, darling of the 'christian' right.
3617	0	a	i think this is something everyone on here can get behind. at least i would hope so. saying that fred phelps is an embarrassment to this nation and my home state would be a gross understatement. sadly, i can't say i'm surprised by this, but i definitely don't think i would have ever predicted it. what he is doing is despicable. and what the patriot guard is doing is amazing. i like the sentiment involved in attempting to pass laws against protesting at funerals (although i don't know if they'll hold up in court), i only wish they had felt the same when he was protesting aids victims.
3618	0	a	that's fantastic! i say you go for it, and... um... pics or it didn't happen.
3619	0	a	why not invite a bunch of famous people? de niro is an incredibly interesting guy; my brother used to work on many films with him as a lighting specialist. he was one of the few folks that actually got to know him. scorsese, on the other hand, i'm sure, like you said, has tons of stories and anecdotes, all of which i'd love to hear! i've got my fair share of intellectual, spiritually magnificent people: ghandi, nietzsche and morello are all fantastic people.

3630	0	a	i'm a bit surprised at the publicity this case has attracted: even here in the uk, the first item on the 10 o' clock tv news last night was a report from outside the court house (waiting for the verdict). i've never heard jackson sing and know next to nothing about his career - why has this case made such a stir in the media ? is it just a fascination with 'celebrity' ?
3631	0	a	that explains it, post 60, page 4. look what comes up for me. i have my forums settings at 40 posts per page. post 121 which came up was the first post at the top of the page.  regarding ip's, the region/part of the country or world they are from can be determined, so i'll make you an additional offer; if he shows that both easyrider and my ip's are located in the same town in nh, i'll still agree to being banned. i say this not knowing where rider is from but i assume he doesn't live in my state.
3632	0	a	as i recall the order of feet was left front foot, right hind foot, left hind foot, and finally right front foot. does that make you happy. oh yes the genes involved are known as peds and numbered in order 1-4. ped1 and ped4 are mirror images of each other (obtained by a process known as reflective copy) and ped2 and ped3 are much the same. this is of course entirely logical and could have been directed or random. the first critter to bear such feet was known as the ftse not to be confused with the index. its predecessors were of course the gimpy series since they had 1,2, or 3 feet and had to hobble along with what they had. ftse-1 is sometimes known as pogo because of its odd 'gait'.

3637	0	a	1. you're kidding, right? have you never watched c-span and listened to congressional inquiries? it's all q&a;and fact driven. i haven't watched tv in quite a few years, and when i did i didn't watch c span.  where are the facts that the court has cited? 2. you have the chance to clear that up (about your denials) yourself. wouldn't i have to be in denial in the first place though?
3638	0	a	oh really?  science does not say 'we dont know x, y, z, but we want to know x, y, z, and so we observe x, y, z, and come up with our conclusions and claim it to be true, or not? (it's a question..) if scientists were too busy learning what is, then the science that is present now, would be non existent, because in order for science to learn and understand, it must be too busy learning and understanding what 'might be', or what it has not known, yet.
3639	0	a	i am trying to become a going in to college for pre-med and i am shocked at the big decline in competion for such courses. not only has obamas healhcare programs overestimated the capability of our current amount of healthcare providers, but it is also deterring many from seeking such careers. by trying to help everyone in the short term, he is doing more damage to everyone in the long term.
3640	0	a	that's not because of something i did. that's because of something that happened back in the 1950s, i believe. that's fine--go ahead and be offensive! it will only hamper your efforts because it only makes people angry at you when you belittle things they hold dear. but what about religious people that aren't out to do that to you and your family? if the govt. endorses a religion, remove the endorsement! that's fine. you're still willing to be offensive to all religious people because of fundamentalists (which are really the ones doing what you describe!). you can be as offensive and show as much lack of respect as you want. it's only going to make it harder on you to convince people.
3641	0	a	oh yeah everytime you downvote someone you lose points so if you don't have that many you go into the negative.
3642	0	a	i'm pretty sure you're joking... but still, if one has the power to acquire and manipulate knowledge sufficiently well, then one can learn to protect himself from bombs and such. my house was recently afflicted by ants. massive amounts of ants. yet their numbers did not amount to much after the strategic placement of a few of these.

3647	0	a	personally i can't stand it when someone uses 'lol'. it's usually used derisively when politeness suggests that leaving it out and responding politely is in order. personally i'm surprised at this thread. the author apparently didn't read the faq.
3648	0	a	dont begin to understand real love till 18 or older i felt real love when i was 13, and i was with that woman i loved for years. saying someone can't effectively do something until they reach a certain age is ridiculous; turning a certain age doesn't magically make you any wiser nor dumber.

3657	0	a	no one believes this. this is a non-issue. i'm not surprised you would respond that way jyoshu. you don't take these issues seriously at all. thus you can have a good laugh, and be sarcastic and think you are witty. in reality, it shows how clueless you are in terms of gay issues. 'the equality-obsessed modern gay pride movement'? gays don't have equality, and therefore there is a movement for that. i don't think anyone is obsessed with equality. i could just as quickly say there is an obsession with keeping gays in an unequal status.
3658	0	a	well...., i hope you're kidding because i don't think that's a fair assessment.
3659	0	a	lol, what did you mean by that? i'm not sure, and dont want to assume the tone you infer with. i thought it was funny but wanted to clarify. ps; i have never called anyone a 'fetus worshiper', although at least that label does not elicit the same evil connotations 'pr-abortion does'. @ simone, no worries hun :)
3660	0	a	dear thetruth, i have posted it as a serious topic. and of course it is meant to get people talking, thinking and arguing. if you were watching/listening to the trump press conference that obama brink into the middle of (beceause he was getting slaughtered), you would take this seriously. btw, on may 23rd (the day after he finisheds the last apprentice show), we can expect some announcement! what it will be i don't know, but i bet it will be trump confirming he will run for president. andy
3661	0	a	i'm not surprised. i have more than that, i also have common sense on my side. firearms don't facilitate killing, firearms facilitate keeping criminals from getting a corner market on domination. the police are outnumbered by the criminals, the criminals are outnumbered by the law-abiding citizens. we shouldn't be unarmed when we're the majority force in maintaining the balance. too bad.
3662	0	a	oh yeah... that... well... but what a sweet way to go, right ;)
3663	0	a	wow... you are bent on harping on creationists arguments at whatever the cost.first of all, you are not even considering that the majority of people are misinformed of what evolution is not because they have creationist motives, but because they go to the dictionary for definitions
3664	0	a	you know, i'm astonished at the fact that during an osce conference on combating discrimination and promoting mutual respect and understanding that took place in bucharest early in june, the attendees discussed all sort of things except the flagrant current situation in poland  this country gains the lead among european countries in violation of human rights in terms of anti-semitism, racism, hatred to moslems, xenophobia, homophobia, and discrimination against hiv-positive persons. this fact was evinced in poland's country report on human rights practices-2006 released by us department bureau of democracy, human rights, and labor. here i present you part of the report that has relevance to the subject. to put it short, there are quite a lot of people in poland who suffer persecution  jews, non-europeans (arabs, moslems, africans, roma), persons of alternative sexuality and hiv-positive persons.
3665	0	a	i'm not surprised. we're living in an age when communication outside of our local group is becoming increasingly common. people are starting to hear ideas they never would have before. religion has generally survived because people's experiences were limited to the views of those immediately around them, those who pretty much shared those same views. today, and for a while now, that's been changing and people are hearing other things causing them to rethink what they've been taught.
3666	0	a	i'm not really surprised at the bush administrations lack of a forest management plan. he known for not being an enviromentally-friendly president. forest fires are usually a natural occurance. they are often good for the eco-systems.it's the man made disasters that are the problem. we can't stop forest fires, but we can keep the property damage to a minimum by thining forests, building access roads where posible to fight the fires, and have stricter control over timber harvests. often the timber companies over-cut certain areas, leaving the lanscape a barren, lifeless terrain, not suited for wildlife habitat. soil erosion can become a problem also, as the silt from the soil erosion pollutes the streams and damages the fish habitat. the government needs a good forest management plan for public lands, and more funding for personel to impliment the current programs of forest management.
3667	0	a	he was a partial-birth abortion provider that killed babies late term. in terms of fetal viability he might as well been killing babies right after they'd been born. i don't condone it, but i'm surprised it didn't happen sooner--one monster killed by another. it wasn't right, but what that sicko doctor was doing was certainly no better.
3668	0	a	well, i'm not surprised. the left coast rarely gets anything right. :)  btw, gm still has over 25% of the domestic vehicle market and it didn't get it by selling econoboxes like the japanese did.
3669	0	a	as compared to how they would be during a period of instability? i said they were internally stable so we agree here, ahem. also the us is not unstable as far as external physical forces are to us. economic forces you could make a point but not the extent that everyone is declaring sanctions against us. that is what north korea is basically doing only it is a physical force that is building against them. the us has no external threat against them at this time that is as threatening as what north korea is facing and that is because the us is far more externally stable than north korea is. i'm not surprised that you declare the us evil for causing instability but give it no credit for creating this stability that we have been focused on.
3670	0	a	ohhh, okay. well, i guess since i don't know, i can't answer that question. i don't really know if i believe. i haven't been given a reason too, but i'm not set in that state of mind, and i acknowledge the potential and likelihood for god to exist.  i'm in the middle.  it's sort of like this (in terms of belief in god):  atheist-------------------agnostic----------------------christian
3671	0	a	money cant fix your problems at all you think that they can but they cant. i think that it can because money has fixed all of my problems.  come on! give me an answer to what can't money fix? leys say your one of those people that would die. how would you feel. i would feel however i was feeling before i died. in the debates hypothetical i wouldn't even know that i was going to die. many things are wrong with killing why cant you see that? wow! there are many things? to back up your assertion, list 5 of these things for me.
3672	0	a	i'm referring to chemist's assertion that mutations cause a beneficial modification to the morphology of hemoglobin. my two links say the hemoglobin becomes 'abnormal,' thus his example fails.  and you are assuming that this mutation is random. why? cancer mutations are not random...they are lead up to by epigenetic changes. why not this? http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-nvo122105.php

3674	0	a	not that i was interested in joining them, but i did read the two links. i'm not much surprised that science has nothing to do with it...and not at all surprised that many actors are into it...hollywood has long been known to generate kooks. i suppose they are just a small portion of the total, but they are very publicized.
3675	0	a	i'm surprised that they still have that on their website after bellesiles was proven to be a fraud. what do you mean by the dates?

3677	0	a	i didn't know that, but i'm not surprised by it. israel needs all the soldiers it can get.  and i disagree with you on the iran war issue. all out war with iran will have the israelis sitting on the sidelines yet again so as not to xxxx off the me allies fighting against iran.
3678	0	a	thanks for that, jason. in esdraelon's defense, there are hundreds of authors of other religions who choose to take portions of our writ out of context, and morph them into something that looks like what he described. (a self-made god who has an alotted portion of the universe.) this is not the actual belief of lds. this is a skewed and exaggerated oversimplification of our doctrine of eternal progression. it's also what seems to be most commonly understood when an lds tries to briefly explain the doctrine.  in other words, i'm not surprised that esdraelon was under that impression.
3679	0	a	it is not appropriate on this site to call people names. i understand that you are still learning in school and are busy, but i think that they taught basic spelling and grammar at a much early age than 16, so there is really no excuse! i did take the time to google your school, but you are too young to realize that maybe this is not the only coolidge hs in the country... so i went with the first google result... i am not impressed, the school gets a 4 out of 10 and 3 out of 5 stars from parents!
3680	0	a	you mean 'junk dna' ? i think it's more than 20%, more like 95% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junk_dna http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...-jdy052804.php http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99995063 i don't think that's what the poster was referring to, i really think he/she was ignorant of what scientists really know. basically, the fact that its there points me in the direction of evolution. also the fact that there are conserved regions of dna within codons and exons points me toward evolution as the explanation. oh, now i see! of course they know what their own acronym stands for. they also know why they named the bases a (adenine) g (guanine) t (thymine) c (cytosine) u (uracil). they named them when they were discovered. i think the poster was saying they don't know how they work, which is quite false. of course, the mechanism of protein transcription has been known for quite some time.

3683	0	a	this has nothing to do with my post. you don't need to believe in conspiracy theories to believe that the universe is pretty crazy. i'm an advocate of science, and even i admit that, especially at the quantum level, shit gets crazy. particles being in two places at once, 95% of the universe being undetectable, whole separate universes colliding to make new ones. it's crazy yes, but it is also scientific. in fact, compared to science, the answers psychics provide are rather boring. i'm impressed by the stuff i just listed, not some charlatan guessing whether or not i have a dog.
3684	0	a	i'm going to presume that you are a christian. why are you a christian? because you happened to have been brought up in a christian family. why aren't you a hindu? because you weren't born in india. if you were born in india, you'd be a hindu. if you were born in central africa, you'd be believing in strange mountain gods.  use your brain, however reassuring and pleasant it is, god does not exist.  oh yeah, and why won't god heal amputees?
3685	0	a	oh yeah, i forgot that you believe that the corporate media and corporate leaders have gotten together to create war and put innocents in jail. i will admit that the powers of the executive branch have gone way too far, but i still believe that being at war means we have to treat the enemy like our enemy, and not like american civilians. do i agree with the war? no. but that's only because i feel that we could have done this all with special forces and not with an invasion/occupation. i would still support detaining terrorists captured in battle/mission (and if they're americans, give them a proper trial, not a military tribunal or some bullshit like that).

3690	0	a	oh yeah! i remember that one... abbynestor was going off on everyone, so i told to to calm down and then everyone (including the people she was ripping on) starting yelling and calling me a dick.  like honestly dana got called a bunch of nasty stuff, i try to defend her and she gets snappy with me...like what? that's why i'm going to stay away from that stuff now.
3691	0	a	agreed. god does exist in some form, whether you want to call god a supreme being or whatever, there is a greater power out there thats beyond our comprehension. in the meantime lets all just get along

3693	0	a	freedom dearie are you serious about pepper spray? just yesterday i presented a story where a taser and bean bag rounds from a shotgun did literally nothing against a 68 year old with a bad heart condition. what can a cheap chemical agent do against an adrenaline charged youth who's got more vitality and health on his side than a senior citizen in new york?

3701	0	a	hello there, my dear fellow, you're using a 19th century definition for a 21st century subject. it doesn't work. what you're writing is pure drivel. there is the caucasian group which you initially mention, then you misuse the terminology, actually meaning the sub-ethnicities of the caucasians. no doubt you're one of those sadly misinformed individuals who believes that 'muslim' is a race. the state of education is surely at an all time low-and getting lower no doubt. cheers from the rockies emoticonxkill emoticonxhoho emoticonxcry emoticonxkill

3703	0	a	*shudder* for whom the bell tolls might be the most horrid book ever devised. junior year english took a lot out of me. an excerpt from the book, paraphrased to the best of my memory: 'darling.' 'yes.' 'i love you.' 'oh.' 'do you?' yes.' 'you love me.' 'i love you.' 'let's hide. in this cave. while the war goes on. and die. alone. in the rain.' 'wait.' 'what?' 'how do we die alone? we're together.' 'oh yeah.' 'i love you.' 'i love you too.' my god, i wanted to tear my eyes out. so instead, i just stopped reading it. ;)  who wrote timeline? i just finished the pelican brief, by john grisham. what an amazing book.
3704	0	a	i'm intrigued as well, most of the bands are in the same size font, this could turn into a whole new debate!!
3705	0	a	i think the the p. bagatti is the one that found the burial caves in 1873, not the bagatti who was working in the mid 40's. i have unable to get a copy of the original manuscript the leadership u describes. i think it is only in italian though. i am surprised that such a  'key discovery' from the 19th century is kept so quiet except by claims of an evangilical web site.
3706	0	a	i see. i just never came through to see it as worth the buy. i guess i borrow a friends copy.
3707	0	a	if i'm spamming a petition, then you're spamming paul krugman, darling. and i've put up plenty of rational arguments with citations. you, on the other hand, have yet to propose one reason why single payer is ridiculous. because we elect representatives to do what we say, not what the lobbyists bribe them to do. you still haven't said anything besides 'stupid', 'ridiculous', and 'maoist' or 'socialist', which is usually what people say about the few politicians who aren't on the take. emoticonxgood
3708	0	a	you're a darling, j. coulda used you here earlier, though, to straighten this mess out. as far as 'stalking' goes, btw, my first appearance here was 11/08/94 (the same day i told those on the ny times board about this forum. ) the poster in question (infamous on the same board, though he pretends not to be) first appeared on 11/16/04. who's stalking whom?
3709	0	a	i'm not 100% sure what set of facts you are working from, but they are not the correct ones i assure you. way more jewish people were killed than died in the iraq war. when you add everyone killed in wwii iraq is not even a comparison. let me make it clear, i'm debating the lesser of two evils here, (speaking of the war, i'm not for the assassination of bush. you can't kill someone for being an idiot, if so kill everyone who elected him, not just him... which would be more people than wwii and iraq war combined by the way)... where was i? oh yeah, there's no comparison. it's an evil (though crazy) ass who caused millions upon millions to die, vs. spoiled governor's son way too dumb for his position listening to douchebags like dick.
3710	0	a	i'm sure i will get bored with the site long before 13000 points. lol! i'm surprised he hasn't.
3711	0	a	wow, thats pretty cool, not that i can afford it or anything. and i doubt it will be as common as the regular car is.  i'm serious about the broccoli though, you would think with all the amazing technology on this planet we could find a way to make healthy food taste good. instead we are making unhealthy food taste like crap.  think about it, broccoli is one of the most healthy foods on the planet, if you ate a full serving of broccoli every day it would increase your longevity by years. now imagine if it tasted just like hershey's milk chocolate.
3712	0	a	allright, well then i think it's odd too, arians would have made more sense. i'm surprised they are considered obscure, the council of nicea is historically considered one of the defining moments of the early christian church, and the arian controvery was it's main event. for the record, they were discussed in my high school, that's why i was making sure.
3713	0	a	first off, i love how you celebrated america's birthday in alaska with mexican food. lol. also, why 1am? what time does the sun set there? i know it's late, but how late? i went to holland in june 2003 and the sun was up well after 10. it was amazing.
3714	0	a	i'm not in the least surprised.. i stated that it was required by law.. i never said anything about when it became a requirement. as of now, in the year 2010 applying for a ss number is required.. would you say that is an invasion of privacy?..  and for your information clinton wasn't the first or last president to rape the social security program.. politicians have been using it as a personal bank for decades.
3715	0	a	if i may hijack this thread (sad to do so as i love seeing people criticise bush), i'm intrigued by this idea that deindustrialisation is a bad idea. if it is, then most of the world is doomed to live in povety surely? there is only a finite manufacturing capacity within the word and it is far less than the total number of jobs required throughout the world. we have to be able to have countries that are heavily reliant upon service based jobs. are you sugegsting that this cannot work in the long term?
3716	0	a	i'm surprised i agree with you on this. the only point i'd add is that the force feeding should only be used while the person is undergoing therapy to fix the underlying problems.
3717	0	a	the 9/11 commission omits the presence of molten steel from their official report. the 9/11 commission omitted it because...??? what is this deep dark secret they don't want the american public to know? which, according to you is easily figured out anyway. 'we could blow up a u.s. ship in guantanamo bay... omg. couple of cia guys brainstorming for solutions to a problem and people go nuts. if that's the worst of what they contemplated...i'm not impressed.  i'm sure conspiracies happen all the time but they are so rare as to be insignifigant. my wife and i can't even agree on a restaurant.
3718	0	a	so in what way are the sperm and egg not human pray tell? are your sperm/eggs from some other species? are they lizard life? elephant life? what kind of life do they have (and you admit they do) outside of human life? sorry but sperm and egg are human and they are alive, how can you deny both statuses? oh yes if both sperm and egg are living matter then the claim 'life begins at conception' is patently false. i will assume you modify that phrase now to be 'human life begins at conception' but that is also clearly false on the face of it.
3719	0	a	oh yes, president obama also has to figure out how to get rid of the bush policy of lies and falseness bush people burrowed into the federal government by bush during his last days as president in order to thwart the spread of science, research and reality.
3720	0	a	haha i don't hate him! he added me as an enemy! :p i was shocked when he did! haha
3721	0	a	okay, at least you gave an example for reagan. i personally think the russians were on the decline long before the end of the cold war, and reagan happened to be president when they finally fell, but we can agree to disagree. for bush i hope you're joking, because it has been quite clear that his policies have more than likely created more terrorists than he has helped defeat (not to mention the numerous other bad things he's done as president). in fact the only really good thing that came out of bush's presidency was that his unpopularity paved the way for obama to become president.
3722	0	a	as we've seen in recent years, kids who are bullied can become so anti-social that they become violent, and attack those who've bullied them with weapons and mass murders. i'm not condoning this behavior, but i'm not surprised that it happens. those who support the bullying of gay kids and others...well, you get what you sow.
3723	0	a	i think in the mind of a psychopath with boundary issues, what the woman was wearing, or where she was at does not matter at all. how do you explain people who get raped in their homes? how about people who aren't dressing slutty, they're just having a drink with a friend, but that friend turns out to have a darkside? i really hope you're joking though.
3724	0	a	i noticed..., you got a public apology. i'm impressed ;)
3725	0	a	quiet the opposite. fossil records give us a snap shoct of location in time going way back. molecular biology, geology, radiography do so as well. where do you get the idea that there is no evidence? everything we have in our heads is what has been taught to us. shoulder's of giants, hun. it is observed. you and i have about one hundred non fatal mutations in our genotype. remember, most mutations are innocuous. not so. only one of a pathogenetic organism needs this and as mutation is pretty common in rappid generation organisms (bacteria) situations the 'chances' are very much in favour of it happening. remember, mutations are happening to every bacteria every generation at random.
3726	0	a	i'm totally surprised i've posted so many posts in this thread: not like me at all.
3727	0	a	i lived in sevilla for the better part of year. spaniards are extremely good at staying out of other people's business. smiling at a stranger on the bus is invasive. i am not surprised most spaniards support gay marriage - most likely because they would never assume it was any of their business.
3728	0	a	i'm a little surprised by this. the polls i've seen show that mass voters favor gay marriage. i would have thought that getting those who oppose it to put their opposition on the record before the elections would be beneficial. then again, seeing as how the lies and fear mongering have already started, i can see how they might want to avoid having the elections muddied with the inevitable dirty fighting that would be thrown at them. not the most couragous stance, but perhaps safer in the long run. you are right that the longer society fails to collapse the more inane the doomsayers seem.
3729	0	a	oh yeah. the things i do for fun just ruin my appetite. i like to look at bacteria under a couple of microscopes i have. sometimes i just place random bacteria together to see how they react. usually they dont do anything. if you do have questions don't be afraid to ask.
3730	0	a	i'm surprised at the density of posters still attempting to tie zarqawi to saddam's government or (prior to us occupation resistance) al qaeda. his actions in iraq prior to the us invasion were limited to kurdish territory, where saddam was attempting to contain that rebellion, and zarqawi was never a disciple of bin laden. zarqawi's bio has been reviewed on the internet many, many times: http://www.weeklystandard.com/conten...4/094npvzg.asp as to al qaeda training camps in saudi arabia, they do exist in spite of publicized saud government attempts to eliminate them. even the most naive poster with even a minute understanding of the saud steel grip on their nation should be able to comprehend that if the sauds didn't want something, it wouldn't be there. and need i mention pakistan? http://www.wtnh.com/global/story.asp?s=1381324 http://www.nationalreview.com/commen...0402090859.asp

3733	0	a	finally an other conservative in this site. i mean who do these people think they are? trying to pass amendments like the fairness act. but i'm not surprised that some order is coming back to are leaders. when the government swings to far to one side, (in this case left) its ganna swing back to the other side, we just as conservatives, need to make sure we don't go to right, or we'll have done just as bad as the liberals.
3734	0	a	hun dont let no ones opinions bother you. no one matters but you, because your living your life and its your body. i personally think everyone shold hold off till 16 but im not going to insult you because thats just plain retarded. what gives you people the right to insult someone for asking a question? im not talking about freedom of speech im talking about being a nice person. nobody has manners anymore, i swear.
3735	0	a	this man has a valid point. but i guess the people he mentions, the extremists and the racists will overlook his wisdom because that's the way they work.

3743	0	a	i agree. hence why we need to evict the gop from the congress today it is evident by the liberal history of the gop majority that they cannot be trusted with money, with the size of government, with foreign relations, with underage pages, with the military in general, with privacy, civil rights or even the most basic function of congress: oversight.  liberalism needs to be evicted from congress, therefore the republicans need to go.  it never stopped bothering me that more democrats voted aganist the schavio bill then republicans. democrats more conservative then republicans? well..given how far republicans have gone over i can't say i'm surprised.
3744	0	a	yeah, that was all just exaggeration and absurdities from religionist to make the story more fantastic and supernatural. or else nobody will ever join them religion.

3749	0	a	i do agree. the rot started here when thatcher came to power, and became chronic when neil kinnock became leader of the labour party. now we have two parties in hock to corporate interests, and even if another party did get elected, their hands are tied because of the reaction of the financial markets. the actions of the ecb in bailing out hedge funds is a sign of how bad it has got. i think we'd best not discuss the solution otherwise we'll start to disagree again. :p george monbiot has the beginnings of a plan in his book age of consent. i'm quite surprised you agree with what is an essentially marxist analysis of the situation though.
