4	1	a	This is pure paranoia. What evidence do you have to support you're point of view? Why don't you actually do a little research yourself. Handgun Control Inc was founded by two victims of gun-violence. Sarah Brady joined Handgun Control Inc after her husband received brain damage from a bullet. Senator Ted Kennedy also supports gun-control because some of his family members were killed with guns. Many people who support gun control have experienced the horrors of gun violence firsthand and are just trying to make our nation a safer place. It's not because they are power hungry.

American oil companies are still trying to get a preferential deal in their dealing with the Iraqi government.Now, what are the gringos and their lackeys (UK, NATO members et al) doing in Afghanistan, which has no oil, and no rubber?

34	1	a	Matthew Levi was a Jew, Trebor, as were all of the Apostles (though they later became followers of another Jew, Jesus). And since you still claim to be an Old Testament Jew, then you need to embrace your own teachings I think. Or else show me in your Tanakh where they've been done away with.
35	1	a	Any evidence to support this or is it just a neat excuse not to take any action?
36	1	a	"It doen't matter what trimester it is in. The shear fact that you are arguing over something as irrelevant as the trimester of the pregnancy means that you already understand that a decision to have an abortion is an intent to take a life. By arguing if the baby is considered living, is just people's way of trying to justify what they already know is wrong, hoping that the excuse of ""if the baby isn't conscious of it, then it isn't that wrong."" It doesn't matter if the baby knows it or not. Even if it was conscious of it, it won't care in a second. The moral dilemma comes in that, you had the intent of killing and that is what makes abortion in any stage morally wrong!!!!The better question is, Should the government take action? because this is a wierd situation where the life is still 100% dependent of the mom and therefore a part of her body. The argument of a soul is negligable because there is no proof of the exsistence to of souls.I have no answer for you, just a plea to please keep an open mind and have compassion for both sides of the argument. It is the only way we can create progress and not hate."

42	1	a	Yeah, right. I'm not going to take that statistic seriously. It doesn't agree with the study done by the Violence Policy Center.
43	1	a	Second, in this very thread Arch has deliberately tied the two as one. There are at least three posts here where he has just done that. You'll notice right off the bat, despite a distinct clarification of YEC, and NOT Christanity as a whole, that Arch deliberately takes the discussion on YEC as a discussion on Christanity. Notice that the only person who argued the thread from a Christanity as a whole view was Arch. The rest of us deliberately stated otherwise.
44	1	a	"In effect you are asking ""To those of you who don't believe in Adam and Eve - what does Adam and Eve mean?"" which is, a nonsense question to put forward.You might be trying to invoke debate from Christians who take a non-literal Biblical approach, if this is what you desire, you have not put the question properly."

Romans 1:24-27; I Timothy 1:10 and Jude 7. If one takes these Scriptures seriously, homosexuality will be recognized as an evil. The Romans passage is unmistakably clear. Paul attributes the moral depravity of men and women to their rejection of ""the truth of God"" (1:25). They refused ""to retain God in their knowledge"" (1:28), thereby dethroning God and deifying themselves. The Old Testament had clearly condemned homosexuality but in Paul's day there were those persons who rejected its teaching. Because of their rejection of God's commands He punished their sin by delivering them over to it."

92	1	a	You have just proven my point MWLA, from your first link, 2nd paragraph at top of page.
93	1	a	the question was about whales. pay attention will you? you're right; i didn't type anything in at all. i just asked huntard to prove his claim. but in response to your propaganda piece, here's some opposing evidence. the third problem, 'as zimmer acknowledges', is that there aren’t very many early whale fossils. does that surprise you? evolutionists have probably led you to believe that the fossil evidence for whale evolution is, pardon the expression, rock-solid. but there isn’t really that much 'hard' evidence. whale evolution is mostly imaginary, or speculative at best. since whales are mammals, evolutionists imagined that a land-going mammal must have returned to the sea. at first, they imagined this without any fossil evidence. so, they went looking for fossils to support their preconceived ideas. the first hint that they were probably right came in 1983, when researcher phil gingerich found a 52-million year old skull in shallow deposits in pakistan. although fragmentary, the skull had teeth that were nearly identical with those of mesonychids and the archaeocetes. … despite the whale-like characteristics of the skull, however, pakicetus lacked two important adaptations which are present in modern whales. in living whales, the ears contain large sinuses that can be filled with blood, allowing the animal to maintain pressure while diving. modern whales also transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear using a 'fat pad', which allows them to hear directionally underwater. pakicetus lacked both of these features, indicating that it was unable to dive deeply and that it could not hear well underwater. these anatomical clues meshed well with its habitat, since the pakicetus bones were found in deposits that had been laid down at the mouth of a river on the shore of a shallow sea, where the opportunities for deep diving would be limited. although no post-cranial bones of pakicetus were found, it seemed logical to assume, from the teeth and ear structure, that the animal spent a great deal of time in shallow water looking for food, but returned to the land to rest, somewhat like a modern sea lion. … the earliest known cetacean, pakicetus, demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whales, and indicates that the cetaceans are descended from the mesonychid carnivores. although we have not found any post-cranial bones from pakicetus yet, ... 5 consider what this evolutionist has just told us. first, they haven’t found any post-cranial bones of pakicetus. [since this essay was written, they have found some post-cranial bones.] post-cranial bones are bones below the skull. so, all they have found is a skull. they don’t have a single pakicetus rib. they don’t have any pakicetus vertebrae. no other bones of any kind. just a skull--and a fragmentary one at that. why do they think it came from a whale ancestor? because its teeth look like whale teeth. but when they look at the ear bones, there is nothing to indicate that it could hear underwater. the skull was found in association with other fossils that lived on the bank of a river or along the sea shore. yet it “demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whales, and indicates that the cetaceans [whales] are descended from the mesonychid carnivores.” in a whale of trouble so the claim is made based only on the teeth because no other evidence supports such a conclusion. that's real complete and reliable information that justifies making such an absolute claim from. not!!! emoticonxdonno

Looking at you answers below I would have though you would understand the concept that I get to choose who I share my life with, who I transfer my property too and who I call family. You do not understand that the government says to everyone who is a family by the issuance of that piece of legal paper. The in equality part comes in when I am told that I can not have that piece of paper but some hetero can because someone else has a religious belief that should have no effect on my life what so ever. I am saying that if so religious XXXXX wants to force their religion on me by using that religion as an excuse for the state not issuing me that piece of paper then I want a say in their life and want the government to remove that belief. If the religious XXXXXX stay out of my life then I will stay out of theirs but if they want to get involved in my life then I want to get involved in theirs. EYE FOR AN EYE equality by its very definition. You want the government out of your life and I want religion out of my government and my life.

123	1	a	"apparently, these ""underlying preferences"" are of absolutely no effect, since the psychological conditioning  of the individual overrides any other ""built-in"" trait factor. therefore these ""built-in"" trait factors are useless in practicality, because nothing about the individual's identity is influenced by them. so why should we even entertain the idea that they exist?"
124	1	a	You do have the right to marry someone you love if you are gay or lesbian in Massachusetts, as of today. Mana'ia, you have the right to marry all of those rich people if they consent. You have the right to marry rich people of the same sex, if you live in Massachusetts. You could even marry someone just because of love who is of the same sex there.
125	1	a	You are speaking in some sort of code.Is it a racist code?
126	1	a	My friend, it was not dishonest, if it was I would work out my salvation with fear and trembling.
127	1	a	Of course men can, do, and should have opinions and feelings about abortion, but to say that your interest is equal to that as a woman is silly. Men will never be pregnant, regardless of what laws stand, they impact men very little in any real way.
128	1	a	You'd have to show me their announcements of bias and conspiratorial intent, before I'd agree that they are as bad as you imply, but I have no question that they admit the possibility of extrapolation of ID for religious purposes far more than atheists admit the possibility of extrapolation of evolution for atheistic purposes. Why? Because Christians have guidelines about lying.
129	1	a	What conceivable connection could that sentence have with what went before --- except, possibly, to agree with me!-
130	1	a	We need some people who can debate fairly without insults or hyperbole on this forum.Unfortunately it doesnt seem that you are one of them
131	1	a	That's where you and I differ. See I view human sexuality as being the exclusive province of the monogamous heterosexual marriage bond.
132	1	a	"Humans attempt to create new species, such as breeding donkey with horses to get mules and lions with tigers to get ligers, but these ""NEW"" species are almost always born sterile and unable to perpetuate themselves."
133	1	a	so then what did Greece and Rome contribute except what not to do????? Jefferson used all of human history as an example of what not to do. So far so good!! The planet is united except for liberalism.then who, why be so afraid?they will half half our percapita income in a generation at current pace. But even if the became purely Jeffersonian and did pass us we will always be the Father of freedom and liberty. before Jefferson that was true.so great they followed Mao to 60 million dead, and now they follow Jefferson. Does the genius ever wonder why there is nothing in their past to follow?
134	1	a	So let me understand..........hypothetically, England is at war with France and you are a dual citizen living in England.............So in that situation you could swear allegiance to France and support them in the war? emoticonXConfused
135	1	a	Yes... nice guessing. Could you elaborate a bit more, though. For example, when and why did he die of hypothermia?

137	1	a	"It's not up to you to "" Save"" anyone.. As far as I'm concerned you can keep your imaginary salvation... I have enough wisdom to realize it's all just a fairy tale."
138	1	a	In a healthy economy, he would be right. This is not a healthy economy. We are using massive government spending and cosumer debt to keep this leaky boat afloat.Under those conditions, where you are based almost entirely on non tangible factors, the damage will help pump the numbers and keep the sheeple headed towards the cliff at a brisk pace.
139	1	a	You seem to be ignoring a whole bunch of passages that reduce that.And, it's amazing how you have to go everyplace BUT Genesis to resolve your difficulty. You have not dealt with the actual words of Genesis.That those passages that define 'yom' as an morning and and evening.
140	1	a	Despite your bull in a china shop rampage through the fields of bioogy, cosmology and paleo, you have not yet given any evidence of a 6000 year old earth, god made in 6 days. How about you provide some?
141	1	a	That would have been alot differant then having intercourse, see that you are pregnant, and aborting it. At least if they decided to have intercourse later, I would still have had a chance to born.

145	1	a	Apparently Germany, Portugal and France (plus the usual suspects: Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Netherlands and Belgium) are all moving toward or already allow same sex unions. Looks like Europe is quietly adapting to the realities of the modern world whilst the USA tears itself apart over the issue yet again...
146	1	a	You're taking that stance again? Arrest people for whatever excuse is convenient and simply let the courts sort out the details at a later date, requiring the accused to pay large sums of money to prove their own innocence?Hardly a civilized approach to the law. Assuming people are guilty and treating them as such, until such time that they can prove that they're actually innocent, just isn't the way to do things.

149	1	a	I didn't misunderstand you at all. Like I said, you are for persecuting religious people if they don't agree 100% with you.
150	1	a	We didn't choose defeat we choose to give up. Choosing defeat would be surrender.
151	1	a	That spiritually-challenged, deluded, lying slug Obama couldn't carry Rick's jock strap. The only reason Obama is even in office is because blacks are voting for a black man and free stuff, Hispanics want no borders, and most women don't know or don't care how bad the Obama liberals are digging America into the ground financially.

157	1	a	It doesn't have to be that way because it's the death penalty. It's that way because of our ever deteriorating legal system.
158	1	a	"I thought I got to the substance of your argument quite well, and prefer not to drone on with a million quotes. If you want to press your argument further you will need to construct an argument as to why ""putting someone in the position"" obligates you to sustain their life, and when doing so you may want to examine the consequences of that position, to see if you can apply it consistently.You put it theretherefore you are responsible for itisn't, in itself, an argument."
159	1	a	Evolution is supposed to be science, and is said to not address religion.
160	1	a	"But the creationists continue to attempt to impose their religion on others as science by the latest ""Intelligent Design"" movement. The ID movement is nothing more than creationism that attempts to avoid a mention of God. Once ID theory (which isn't theory since it is not based on evidence and testing) is allowed into the schools, then the next step will be to introduce the fundamentalist Christian god as the designer."
161	1	a	Oh good grief!I have always lived in rough areas. In one city, Alburquerque, a drug deal went sour 10 feet fom where I slept, and a guy had his head blasted away by a shotgun.Where I worked, less than a block away, a gunner massacred everyone in a video rental place.I was even obliged to ferry a guy with a slash on his throat to an ER, I didn't know the stupid beast, I was scared to death, but I felt it my Christian duty (even though I am not a Christian) to get the guy to where he could get treatment.And I don't own a damned gun because I am not chicken-hearted.

165	1	a	So, you're saying the god of the old testament and the god of the new testament are different gods? What happened to the old one? Why isn't this mentioned in the bible? Why does it keep referring back to the OT without mentioning that the god that is around today is a different one?

168	1	a	Yawn, refer to the above post you clever little cookie. You're obviously the other 'half' of the brain cell missing from the preacher.
169	1	a	"__________________________________________________ _______________THE FOLLOWING ANALOGY IS PURELY HYPOTHETICAL, AND DOES NOT REPRESENT MY ACTUAL THOUGHTS ON CHRISTIANITY IN ANY WAY. I think Christianity is unnatural. I think belief in God is a disorder and sign of a mental defect, and the things they do behind closed doors, drinking ""blood"" and ""eating flesh"", ICK. It's a negative behaviour pattern that requires overcoming. That being said, I don't really have a problem with Christians, as long as I don't have to pay for their health benefits and pensions, not to mention all of their tax free enterprises. This whole dependent class of Christians is a huge drain on the atheist working population of the country and we should not be forced to pay for their benefits, let alone to recognize them as being equal. It's clear to me that they should be denied these benefits due to these ""facts"". __________________________________________________ _______________"
170	1	a	Of the court cases that have been decided over 92% have resulted in convictions. Statistically, it's highly unlikely that there will be big deviance from this pattern for the remaining cases. I don't think presenting information that shows that people with concealed handgun permits very likely kill more innocent people than criminals is a punch in the face to the VPC.
171	1	a	volcanoes do more to contribute to global warming than an unchecked industrial society. toxic gases, giant ash clouds, thousands of degrees of heat being released anytime there's anything approaching an eruption, it's not a pretty picture. molten rock isn't the most environmentally friendly substance you'll ever encounter.
172	1	a	Thank you for your apology. There you were implying I had no right to talk about America, I'm glad you've 're-invited' me into this debate.
173	1	a	But in all reality.. a baby is no more different at 2 months old than an embryo...
174	1	a	Here is how your three steps should look.1. If a cruel action is causally linked to someone's inevitable death, they are responsible for that death.

176	1	a	no, just overturn roe vs wade.
177	1	a	I am not JUST superior because I see the world with an odious light. I'm also superior because I have a rediculous intellect, a sizable bank account, good looks, high social standing, excellent health, the tenacity of a wolverine and the ruthlessness of man. I have an arsenel to rival many 3rd world armies, the will to use it and the history of doing so. I have the wit and experience of dealing with the US legal system and exploiting its many loopholes to my personal benefit. I have impecable taste and a handfull of fellows in my thrall. I have the voice of an angel and can cry on demand and have magic woman attracting pheromones.On top of all that, I have a key to the pearly gates and offer advice in many areas to the old sky god and if you kiss my XXX, I'll put in a good word for you.
178	1	a	Do you have a fire extinguisher in your house? I have never had a fire in my kitchen but I still keep a fire extinguisher in there. I look at wearing firearms for self defense the same way I look at wearing a seat belt. I wear it and pray I'll never need it, but I'll be damn glad I'm wearing it if I do need it.
179	1	a	so stalin didn't actually practice communism (not that anyone has), but really just used bits and pieces to further his rule and such ideology is not communism but stalinism. so in essence, stalin wasn't a commie.

There is absolutly no question but that she woudl not have wanted to live as a veggie, and now that the autopsey is done, there is absolutly no question that she was a veggie.

182	1	a	If you can physically transfer your property to your son before you die, then it's his. I don't have a problem with that. However, if your son claims that you gave the wealth to him, in name only, on your deathbed, and all he has to prove it is word of mouth or documents that may be fraudulent, then it's not his.
183	1	a	Sure I can! The bible has lasted thousands of years under the constant and unending scrutiny of being judged by archeology and every historical discovery in the middle east throughout that time. Never has it been shown to be fictional or false in any way so it has most assuredly stood the test of time yet your ilk continues to deny it can be the truth it has been shown to be with every new discovery.
184	1	a	Give that man another cheeseburger! (Maybe he'll choke on it this time.):p
185	1	a	if it is true that having a membership of over 2000 members means that you 'really have no idea who is walking through your doors,' then it's not an argument for armed guards; it's an argument against big crowds.
186	1	a	Alas, I can no longer drink any sort of alcoholic beverage, although I used to love to drink the excellent foreign beers, high grade gin, scotch, brandy etc., in other words, sipping whiskey as opposed to the cheap raw stuff that the lower classes guzzle up.

188	1	a	Hello everyone, I am a high school student seeking help. Me and my partner are about to enter a debate on firearms, and we already know that we are for guns. Can you all just tell me if you are for guns or not and a short reason why?Thank you.
189	1	a	You can ignore the statement by D.J.Futuyma and identical ones made by Gould, Mayr, Dawkins, Dobzhansky and others but not without departing from mainstream evolutionary biology.

194	1	a	Your boy shot a four-year old. THAT's killing children.
195	1	a	Thanks Voice. It's good to see that there is a voice of reason here.
196	1	a	why did god in all of his power and might need to say ok youre going to evolve slowly over millions of years into something else when all he did was simply speak and it was done?
197	1	a	I'm pretty sure this guy was removed from his position after the broadcast by the palesitinian authority. He's no different from the Southern Baptist types who suggest nuking the middle east.
198	1	a	Then go away. If you have no interest, then why on earth are you even here to debate?Besides this, you're trying to put killing human beings on the same platform as animals or organic plant life. I'd seriously suggest you reconsider your views on what exactly is more important. You cannot put those things together, they mix about as well as oil and water.If the court or parental unit is not allowed to interfere with abortion plans, does the mother have the right to kill the child? Who is she to interfere with her child's life if her own parents can't make her live with a baby she can just give up for adoption?By the way, only 1% of abortions are made because of rape. If it were my decision, I would outlaw abortion altogether for the other 99% who have abortions irresponsibly and save over a million lives. Don't get me wrong, I do feel for victims of such crimes, but a few thousand hardly outweighs over a million. And they don't even have to die! They just have to live with a baby for a few months, and they can get on with their lives! It's more of a chance than the baby will get otherwise.
199	1	a	Lurch:So scientists are the ones who define everything?
200	1	a	"This is why I do not advocate the American Holocaust that has destroyed nearly fifty million unborn children on the altar of ""choice""! Shadow's reasoning that ""I'll have a baby when I'm ready"" smacks of pure, unadulterated selfishness. I do not give a tinker's damn about the reason nor circumstances. When that child is conceived, all bets are off and the focus must be on that child!!!"
201	1	a	Guilty of the rapes I'm not disputing (don't know anything about those cases), but why does that automatically make him guilty of the rape and murder for which he was executed?
202	1	a	it ought but it won't, at least not the gun fetishists in this forum, who IMHO are prisoners of their ignorance, their fears, their insecurity. They are simply insane and no dialogue is possible with them. They are immune to reason.

I guess your little geographical generalization forgot to take into account the individual free will that each of us possesses.

209	1	a	That is why most pro-choicers support a time limit to abortions. But pro-lifers are I are even opposed to anti-conceptives. They are just religious fundamentalists.

216	1	a	When Rep. Carson gathered reporters around him to spread the myth of racial slurs being hurled “fifteen times” he painted the protesters not just as racists, but as a terrorist threat. We know this, because Kerry Picket of the Washington Times recorded Rep. Carson as he explained it all to eager reporters.KERRY PICKET (Wash. Times): Do you think the people outside are generally dangerous or no?REP. CARSON: Oh absolutely. I worked in homeland security. I'm from intelligence, and I'll tell you, one of the largest threats to our internal security…I mean terrorism has an Islamic face, but it really comes from racial supremacist groups. (inaudible) Its the kind of thing we keep a threat assessment on record [for].PICKET: From groups like this?REP. CARSON: Oh absolutely.

218	1	a	And LIVING ones even more... ok Adolph.
219	1	a	I neither said that nor implied anything of the kind. I'll be gentle with you and assume that you simply misinterpreted my statement.
220	1	a	Insanity is the belief that laws are pointless since someone always breaks them.
221	1	a	You mean Intelligent Design, and straight forward logical, rational, common sense arguments that require reason to move to the next step, instead of ideological consensus... huh? go figure... Proponents of ID usually don't argue religiosity or scripture, they let the empirical evidence prove it, funny... that is what true science has always done. Verify the obvious, not ignore it in favor of some mindless postulations [oddly] convenient to how someone wants to live their life; amazing how that works out...

223	1	a	Okay, let's look at evolution.
224	1	a	Good way to prove exactly what I am talking about christianists and these dominionists in particular want to oppress gay people.
225	1	a	Biology shouldn't simply deal with the facts about different animals, natural selection, evolution, etc. but should also deal with how information is gathered, and different ways of analyzing it as well as different hypothesies rather than what is thought at the time to be the facts.

232	1	a	That is the standard textbook answer, but it does not respond to my post. If you were to ask ronound economists of today like Nobel Prize winner Milton Freedman or Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan (from the book Capitalism) they would disagree with this standard textbook answer.

238	1	a	I think the crazy came first and the zealootry is just a symptom. I see OCD and mania is zealotry. Obssessiveness is not healthy - regardless of what your obsessing over. Also, one needs to be careful about the lable. For example, nt everyone who opposes gay marriage for religious reasons is a zealout. I would say most are not. Take Easy and JP. Both have religious reasons for opposing gay marriage (that should not be the problem of anyone outside their faith, but I digress...), however I would only call Easy a zealot. JP may be an occasionally obnoxious conservative apologist who can even teeter on redneck from imie to time, but he is no zealout.

240	1	a	SS and Medicare (which funds Medicaid) are off-budget items and funded trusts. SS administration is budget item, peanuts.

241	1	a	If you want to continue foisting this lie I'll keep exposing it.
242	1	a	And it's so bleedin' unnecessary, too! Why not just create the universe as it is? And just let the light take it's sweet time to get here? Imagine what proof for creationism that would be: we can only see stars out to 6000 light years or so; looking at old star charts we realize that people 1000 years ago could only see stars out to 5000 light years; and as time goes by additional stars appear in the sky as the light from them finally reaches us. If God did create the universe only 6000 years ago, the fact that we can see the entire universe now can only count as a deliberate, I will repeat, a deliberate, oh how I love that word, DELIBERATE deception on the part of the creator.

It seems to be 'politics first, comedy after', something comedians of all persuasions are vulnerable too: what you would call 'liberal' comedians here in Britain were often so angry about Iraq that their sketches devolved into rants.Incidentally, what does the US have against the EU constitution? Is it fear of a superstate with greater economic clout, or just 'those darnded Europeans, with their welfare'?

And if they were the imaginings of bronze age sheep herders as your atheists/evolutionists would have you believe, then how did these ignorant people describe creatures we can now recognize from fossil evidence? And while your at it, ask yourself if it's reasonable that the bones of dead creatures have survived from 60 million years to some estimated to be more than 200 million years without becoming dust?
286	1	a	So the start of personhood for a particular person is a variable, based on that individual's memory. Twenty years ago I could remember events at my fourth birthday, but today those memories are gone. For a while I had personhood at 4 years of age, but today, looking back, I did not have personhood until I was 6. As I age and my memory fails, it may turn out that I did not have personhood until I was 21 years old. Personnhood comes and goes.Do I have it right?”Not aware”???????Not aware of what?Shoot a gun behind them and they will flinch. They are aware of loud noises.Throw them wildly into the air and they will cry. They are aware of their own movement.Pinch them, they will cry.They are self aware as they chew on their toes.And of course puppies are aware as well.Unless of course I do not understand what you mean by aware.

297	1	a	The difference, and I think it is a significant difference, is that Omegamon spoke of feeling the threat of potential harm. I believe that understanding the risks that are faced every day does not require being fearful of those risks. Nor does it require being stupidly fearless. We all take reasonable steps to reduce our risk of danger every day. To me, the use of a firearm to reduce risk does not seem all that reasonable. The intent of my opening post was to find out why Omegamon and others feel differently.

While the discoverer may have thought it was a human tooth, it was a newspaper that reported the find as being some race of human. Actually it was after further finds were made that it was realized that the tooth wasn't human. Again, it was never claimed by science to be a race of man. No description and no publishing means that it was never presented foramlly to science.You creationaries are so cute. You have to keep pretending that this kind of thing is meaningful. It is meaningful only to reveal the integrity of creationaries and christianaries.

Gay marriage creates a new dependent class of citizen2. It is an unfunded mandate and therefore, illegal3. It forces additional costs on an employer via healthcare benefits4. It adds costs to the court system via increased litigation over custody, property, inheritance, etc.,5. It allows more people to lay claim to finite SS and other entitlement benefits6. It establishes a loophole to transfer property without payment of inheritance taxes.7. It establishes a mechanism to bypass the payment of taxes on life insurance payouts.These should be enough fodder to get the ball rolling."

Even Fox News puts the attendance in five digits, yet FW tries to pretend they are much larger.2) Pretend a uniformity of presence behind a rational banner, when the truth is that a LARGE segment of attendance sits behind a looney banner (like calling the president racist or Kenyan or secret Muslim or fascist / socialist / communist / nazi).THAT is my point.Or an even more popular one?The strawman argument!"

You may have bought into that image lesz, but I can plainly and clearly see the full extent of the misery index which comes with the homosexual lifestyle.

You do not seem to think this should be done. This is the main reason why people treat you the way they do. It actually has little to do with them practicing objectivism or scientism.

493	1	a	“Either God exists or he doesn't. It is a scientific question. The existence of God is a scientific question, like any other.”This is idiotic. Science investigates material phenomena, observable entities in the universe. No competent theologians or philosophers – not even the atheist ones – have ever declared that God (if he exists) is an object in his own universe. Perhaps there is no God, and intelligent Christians readily admit that there may be some legitimate doubt. But if the Judaeo-Christian God exists, then he is the maker of the universe and not an entity within it.
494	1	a	You have obviously been told this by a pro-choicer who will leap to any rationale no matter how shallow in order to justify his/her defense for abortion. He fails to appreciate that preventing an egg from being fertilized is not at all similar to murdering a fetus which is in many cases at a minimum of up to 3 months of development. Hi Ryuuichi, If I might defend your doctor for a second, I think I can explain his thinking. He/she understands that what you think you want at 17 yrs. old MIGHT be very different than what you will want when you are in your 20s and in love with your potential soul mate. At that time, when the man of your dreams is real and you two actually discuss your future lives together, if you then decide to get your tubes tied and never have children, he will be confident that your decision is rational and based on a mutual decision with your spouse. See the difference? To make that decision now could and probably would be greatly regretted since most men you meet in your 20s who fall in love with you will desire to have children with you one day. Very few men would choose to marry a woman who could never give them natural children. In fact, I can say with confidence that to make such a permanent decision without including the man you will fall in love with and want to marry one day is probably the most selfish decision a woman could make. Think about it as a woman in love some day and you will see my point, I'm sure. emoticonXAngel

It's a separate issue from the moral one.Remember, it's natural for animals to do many things--some species' males impregnate the females and leave forever the female to raise the offsrping on it's own. But just because such behavior exists among animals doesn't make it moral in humans. In fact I'd call it immoral.

520	1	a	"Happygrl35, the premise from the man's perspective is the same arguement pro-choicers argue, all they are doing is legally terminating a mass of tissue, not a human being. According to pro-choicers, life isn't conceived at conception, so if I man after having sex with a woman and the woman becomes pregnant, she is not pregnant with a baby, she is pregnant with a cell that can ""develop"" into a baby. If a man say's I opt out of fatherhood prior to the development of a human being, then he too like the woman already has, should have the opt-out option. A woman can do with her body what she so chooses, like she does, however, everyone including women must mitigate their own damages. If a woman who is pregnant with a few ""cell clusters"" and she so chooses to let the pregnancy of cells develop into a human being, she is allowed to do so, but she caused the development of a human baby not the man, and should be solely liable for such creation. Remember, when the man left after having sex, he did not create a human being according to pro-choicers, if at most he created a ""cell"". According to pro-choicers, cells do not translate into a human life. A male should have an opt-out period just like the woman, before the cells become a HUMAN BEING.emoticonXHoho God, I love it. Pro-choicers don't even want to live by their own words. I'm trying to understand their position. Its a ""cluster of cells"", ""a mass of tissue"", ""not a human being"", ""no heartbeat"" ""no brainwave therefore, not a human being yet"", so if a man say's I opt out of fatherhood prior to the creation of a human being then, like his female counterpart, should be able terminate his parental duty, that he never created, she did.

But then they can't explain why fetuses aren't listed on the US Census, or why there isn't a funeral every time a woman has a miscarriage. Pretty much, along with the rules of having children, you would have to acquire the birth certificate during conception, you would have to pay taxes for children, even if you're only pregnant, etc.Or am I missing something?

578	1	a	Without question my largest beef with God would have to be the fact that according to the Bible you need to believe in God in some fashion or another in order to make it into heaven. The reason this is my beef with him is because it is much more difficult to believe in him when you are born in India than if you are born in the US or Europe. The Indian culture is that of Hinduism and a mix of other religions unlike that of the US and Europe which is primarily Christian. That means being born in the US or Europe gives you a better chance of making it to heaven as you are more likely to end up being a Christian and believing in God. Would the be at all fair if this were the case? My answer is plainly and simply no! It is idiotic infact. If God existed and he was perfect then almost without a doubt he would have to base getting into heaven on the actions of a person instead of the beliefs of a person to be fair. His system would not be at all perfect if being born in one place means you get into heaven while being born in another place means you don't get into heaven. Furthermore this means that he needs to take into consideration other influences on your life including whether or not your parents or community were proper places to grow up and whether or not you were ever given the proper situation in which to change your life to God's expectations. If not given any opportunities or given very few and still turning out to be a decent person should be better than if you turned out to be a decent person and were given many opportunities to end up this way. God in all his perfection would need a very complicated system to judge who gets into heaven in order for it to be fair but I just don't see spelled out in the Bible.

612	1	a	At the risk of becoming embroiled in a seemingly heated exchange, I think I might interject with a little history....To answer Smiley's question: “who wrote the constitution?” I would say the answer is found in the preamble to the document: “We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” (bold emphasis added)
613	1	a	I realize you're praying that I didn't notice, but look at the sharp downturn at the 2000 mark, which completely nullifies the point you're trying to make. It's amazing how you are able to see only the facts that you choose to see, and deny those facts that contradict what you want to believe. If you'll note, the blue line is the annual average.http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedi...ure_Record.png

615	1	a	Oh well. At least from my studying it seems that the Christian worldview is not correct in any way, shape or form. But still, if anyone wants to convince me, please do.
616	1	a	Come to that... given that all humans start out as a single cell, that's definitely false.

627	1	a	"So if a drug addict, or an alcoholic stands up and says, ""God made me this way"", should we accept that fact, and give them drugs or alcohol."
628	1	a	That's it? That was your post? To attack a source without anything backing you up? Bravo!
629	1	a	Ok ... I have to stop to take issue with something here, that I see all too often. And I've held my tongue on this as long as I can.
630	1	a	By the way, my personal opinion is that real scientists are trying to be objecticve and actually explore something before completely trashing it.
631	1	a	Families can multiply a lot faster than you think. I'm not sure of the correct time, but there is nothing that says it couldn't have happened in that time period. The incestually conceived sons went out and found other people and married whom they pleased. They could have married a women who had children, and had even more children. Then they could have returned.That area that was so populated was nothing when Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed, and any people living around it left. Why else would Lot's daughters commit incest to bring forth children?
632	1	a	If there's one thing I can count on, it's your insistence on 100%, beyond any possibility of apologetic excuse creation, demand for absolute proof (with video-tape) if anything involves criticism of Christianity or evangelicals or some association thereof...
633	1	a	Yeah, they want the government to do that for them. Eases the conscience if you just vote for someone to make life's tough decisions for you.

637	1	a	I didn't realize you could just summarily disregard a poster's source without providing any info to back this up. You then proceed to attempt to refute unkerpaulie's points but fail to provide any source to support your claims. As far as I can tell you aren't a medical professional who specializes in pre-natal care and development so your argument can't really stand up to criticism on its own. Your can only refute another's points if you have solid data to back them up.

640	1	a	Yeah, a slave contract that would be illegal to enforce in any other situation. And luckily, is illegal to enforce in most (all?) advanced nations today. You want to revert back to taliban-like legislation?
641	1	a	Second, the majority of the world believes there is a god, and the others don't want to believe (hope there isn't) a god
642	1	a	If we were created in God's image, then it would make sense that equally our emotions are a reflection of God's emotions. That our emotions are imperfect versions of his.Of course I would personally say that when man invented god, they felt the need to give him human characteristics in order to make their invention more understandable. And to assist in the oppression of others by the ever-present threat of an 'angry god who will smite you'. An 'ambivalent god who is above that sort of thing' just isn't as good at convincing people that whatever you say is right.
643	1	a	But how can you be against a proven method of reducing abortions at the same time?
644	1	a	PERIOD. God is good, and humans have theorized various stupid concepts trying to discredit their inner convictions to be rampant perverts many a time....NOPE.

Or have you entirely abandoned that effort?Btw only you guys are calling it fine print, loophole, weasle hole, whatevas. I'd call it an exemption providing for self-defense.
650	1	a	Well, answering you seems to be a waste of time.You ignore/reject any attempts at explaining the things you clearly do not understand, and youlater bring up the exact same things that you have had explained to you as if the subject was never broached before.You are incorrigible and uneducable.

653	1	a	You say that homosexual relationships should be all that there should be because hetero sex is wrong. Using your logic there would be no more children because nobody would be straight. After everyone died humans would no longer exist because there would be no offspring. Very intelligent I must say. Great way to preserve the human race.emoticonXBanghead This is how I feel everytime I hear a dumb statement like that.
654	1	a	If I ever ran on a platform like this i'm positive i'd never get elected, but I still think they're some mighty good ideas:1) Organ markets. Legalize the buying and selling of human organs and save not only a ton of lives, but tons of money by cutting down on medical expenses like kidney dialysis..
655	1	a	Fair enough. But are there other things that could have been done to prevent the invasion before it happened? I'm not trying to diminish you sense of safety or personal security, I am genuinely curious.
656	1	a	Uh, there is love minus sex, and sex minus love. What are you calling it?Are you simply jealous because you lack writing skills and no one has considered you for anything outside of menial labor? LOL.
657	1	a	Preach on JP. Its one of those shiny moments when you are actually right.
658	1	a	Nice job moving the goalpost, and changing the subject also. Show where in BCR's post which you quoted above, he said even spoke to the issue of genes? He said no new functions have evolved in a population in which it hasn't existed before. And regarding your fallacious example regarding nylon eating bacteria, are you suggesting that the chemical ingredients that make nylon never existed before man combined them to create nylon? The bacteria works on a microscopic level and couldn't care less what product we have made from those chemicals which it thrives on. So your example is both fallacious and moot.

677	1	a	What's the scoop here?It seems to me with all the shootings that occur in the United States because of all the gun happy nuts running around, everyone would know how to do first aid at the site of a shooting.Good idea simone, when do you start your training.I understand bullet wounds are kind of nasty because they're deep. There's also the massive loss of blood; To be sure, the massive bleeding would wash out nasty debris but a body can't stand to lose a bunch of blood.
678	1	a	What I marvel at is that you're not even embarrassed to ask such an ignorant question. Because if it's a chicken egg, and if it's allowed to incubate to term, it sure isn't going to be a crow when it hatches. And to be even more simplistic, a chicken egg is still a chicken while it's in the egg. Just as a human being is still a human being in the womb.

684	1	a	I think that's exactly why the anti-gay marriage crowd would never go for that idea. That is part of the reason that you see PRO-GAY proponents typically bring up this idea, and the anti-gay opponents typically remain silent.

689	1	a	"Anti-choicers don't give two whits about life, or really believe in the absolute value of a fetus. This story is a good example of that. I bet a lot of so-called ""pro-lifers"" would support this court's decision, even though the mother posed no real threat, and she could have miscarried the fetus:For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care. They wouldn't defend that right either.Because they DON'T care about the fetus. They don't care about life. They don't care about health. They care about power and money and pushing people around. That's all."
690	1	a	Whatever you think about what she was intending to do or not -- though she communicated quite clearly -- is rather irrelevant given the offense and those surrounding circumstances.I bet this is your opinion ANY time the story concerns a black defendent and a white police officer.

You'd be riding an expensive bicycle and eating expensive dog food. Don't believe everything your politicians tell you to conceal US industrial ineptness. China will continue adjusting the Yuan peg to USD in small increments until US markets are no longer required or desired by Japan or China.
693	1	a	Revisionist history by gays is still revisionist history. While AIDS can be spread through heterosexual sex, I stated that it was homosexual sex that put AIDS over the critical mass needed to perpetuate and spread. Deny that. emoticonXCensored
694	1	a	this is the omega word
695	1	a	"Among homosexual men in particular, casual sex, rather than committed relationships, is the rule and not the exception. And even when they do enter into a more committed relationship, it is usually of relatively short duration. For example, a study of homosexual men in the Netherlands (the first country in the world to legalize ""marriage"" for same-sex couples), published in the journal AIDS in 2003, found that the average length of ""steady partnerships"" was not more than 2 < years (Maria Xiridou et al., in AIDS 2003, 17:1029-1038)."
696	1	a	I'd still rather be chased by a person with a knife than run a zig zag pattern in an attempt to evade a bullet.
697	1	a	behavior dictates risk. some practices are 'more risky' than others. but to say gays are more prone to hiv infection, suggest that heterosexuals are immune, or less prone...which is factually false. role models?? what are you talking about? you don't even know.  old camp fruits? you've lost the little mind that you had.  your daddy is more of an 'old camp fruit', than i ever could be, girlfriend.  and i'm in a monogamous marriage for the past 10 years. i need no announcements. you?
698	1	a	NOTE: When I say beneficial mutations, I am not talking about a gain of new genetic information to the genome. The organism can survive in the environment by a loss of genetic information i.e. the loss of a function, for example the loss of wings of a beatle on a windy island helps it to survive. If they had wings, they may be blown into the ocean and drown. Over time, you may get a population of wingless beatles - the adaption would be mutation by natural selection. Not evolution. Which also fits beautifully with the creation account.

714	1	a	When placed on the ballot instead of being rammed down the public's throats by activist courts and out-of-touch legislators, gay marriage has a ZERO - 31 record. The fact is that the public, when it exercises its Constitutional Right to decide via the ballot box, has decided against gay marriage EVERY TIME.Gays can't blame the Christian Right and the Mormons for spending $Millions on this one.

But sometimes she was in such pain that she resisted, and then she said she would be dragged down to a torture chamber in the basement.“Many of the brothels have these torture chambers,” she said. “They are underground because then the girls' screams are muffled.”As in many brothels, the torture of choice was electric shocks.

732	1	a	LOL. You are quick as a whip. :pJP and I have been around and around on this point a hundred times, we both know where the other stands (and the truth is somewhere in the middle :p ). It was an attempt at humour between the two of us rather than diving back into the same old argument that is completely off topic to the thread.

739	1	a	You said in one post you are a ex-christian. If you new anything of Christianity you would know this is not possible. It is possible you had the title of Christian without the relationship which gives you this title. Christianity subscribes to the power of God to save you, not of any power of your own. If one could be come unsaved, he becomes more powerful than God (Impossible within Christianity).
740	1	a	that's a false analogy. people who are sexually attracted to children harm children, and harming someone is a crime. homosexuals do no harm to anyone, and are nothing like pedophiles. and for someone who doesn't tolerate government intrusion, you sure seem to like government intrusion when it comes to interfering with marriage. huh? are we talking about gays or fornicators? fornicators being someone who has sex before marriage and gay being a man who is attracted to a man in the same way a straight man is attracted to a woman. lets stay on topic.

A thing cannot suffer, cannot feel pain, fear or even feel anything for that matter. How can you have empathy for a thing? Once a fetus develops a mental existence, then it is a person worthy of protection, as are all people.

You go on and on about a women's choice when it comes to her body and how everyone else should stay the heck out of her business but then when people want to own weapons for personal defense/usuage. People that haven't committed crimes and have been physiologically examined. You go: NO! That's WRONG! You can't have your choice! I'm being affected by it! (Even when its obvious NO you are not being effected by their choice to bear arms) And you lot call pro-lifers hypocritical for being pro-death penalty. Pfft.

775	1	a	"Saving lives is a Republican goal?Then, why have the Republicans condemned us to this ugly, nonproductive war in Iraq?The terrorists continue to terrorize us because we have deterred our efforts against them to Iraq, (and Bush intends to widen this nonproductive war into Iran and Syria) where nearly 700,000 Iraqis have been needlessly slaughtered, where more than 3,000 of our young have been sacrified in vain, and you have the audacity to say that ""saving lives is a Republican goal.""Meanwhile we burn Saudi Arabian oil and by so doing, fuel the funding of countless schools of hate against the United States throughout the world.Osama bin Laden, the prime terrorist in the world, issued out of Saudi Arabia. He was funded by Saudi Arabia. Most of the terrorists on those planes that attacked my nation on September 11, 2001, were from Saudi Arabia.Iraq had nothing to do with that attack. Iran had nothing to do with that attack. Syria had nothing to do with that attack.Ever had an attack of reality, Gman?"
776	1	a	Is this the sort of thing that is being taught at that bastion of liberal science, MIT? How can this be presented as fact rather than theory?New and improved nuclear fuel createdNuclear fission, neutrons and protons, and even the atom itself are just theories. No one has ever seen an atom or a neutron. No one has ever observed an atom split. Why are our liberal news media allowed to present this as fact?Moreover, aren't nuclear reactors designed by intelligent humans? I also notice that this research was funded by our hard earned tax dollars without requiring that the benevolence of God also be researched in equal time. This is yet another shameful example of the godless attitude of science.

787	1	a	First off, just because some Iraq's are crazy and use their children as weapons, does not mean all Iraqi's are such. Second, I think people use the younger people for wars for a couple of reasons. One reason is they are easier to convince to do something like go to war than a guy that is 40 or older. Every country uses their young people for war. They are also more physically fit. .

789	1	a	Atheists do, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they represent science. You haven't gotten in over your head – most who post here don't know much about science. TQ doesn't, and of course he'll tell you that I don't. There's a big difference between science, and the creation/ evolution controversy. Many atheists who seem to be interested in science are actually only interested in it to the point that it helps them feel “intellectually fulfilled”, to discredit religion. Some of the best reading on the creation/evolution controversy isn't written by scientists, but by philosophers who have done just enough scientific homework on the subject to keep a clear focus on the controversy, without confusing it with too much detail. Michael Ruse and Bradley Monten are two excellent atheist authors on the subject. Religious authors, practically too many to name. William Dembski, David Berlinski, Phillip Johnson, Cornelius Hunter, many others. You would do well to read anything by any of these people. Far too many young people seem to make the mistake of getting most all of their information from rabid atheists who are also degreed biologists, like Richard Dawkins. He's become a celebrity, and most degreed biologists who are not rabid atheists are a little to timid to take him on in a very direct way, without fear of discrimination, academic or otherwise. Michael Behe is one of the few who has been somewhat successful at it, not in avoiding discrimination, but in his ability to make a comfortable living in spite of it. Read “The Edge of Evolution”, or “Darwin's Black Box” sometime. :)

793	1	a	OH, OH, OH.., How much you'd like to relegate your immorality to the devil. That's a convenient out.
794	1	a	Right. And that is the reason for peer review. Creationists don't subject their ramblings to peer review. That is why so much care is devoted to the proper construction of experiments to test the hypotheses by real scientists. Creationists just invent ad hoc stories without any experimentation.

815	1	a	Well let's look at the facts themselves. Concealed carry laws are now part of the legal system in 48 out of the 50 states in this country. Concealed carry started in Florida and worked their way from one state to another over a continuous 20 year period, and not once has a concealed carry law ever been repealed, for any reason.Gun control laws, like handgun rationing, mandatory reporting standards, ammunition registries, secondary background checks, trigger lock and storage requirements, etc. are limited in their reach, sticking to only certain states. There's been no mass adoption of these laws by various states across the country, and there's even been cases of them being repealed due to ineffectiveness.If gun control laws worked at controlling crime, and the presence of firearms actually had the potential to increase crime rates, these facts would be reversed.

It's internally confidential, and, seeing as how I work for an oil/gas company, he couldn't give me details.Suffice to say, in his opinion, it didn't look real promising, data was very limited, and given what was available, any estimates are pretty shaky.

838	1	a	so by your various definitions, left-handedness makes that person a deviant. most of america is right handed (so it would be considered the norm), left-handed people function different than right handed people as well as behave differently in the way the go about their lives. are left handed people wrong and unnatural as well? no one has determined why people are left-handed, and whether it is caused by genetics or early environmental stimuli. they are deviating from the norm. did you know that the word sinister is derived from the old english meaning 'left handed' due to old beliefs about left-handedness? do you actually (by your previous arguments) believe that left-handedness is wrong? if you don't, then you cannot possibly apply your arguments to homosexuality. if you do, i'm sorry, but you are ignorant.

852	1	a	Would depend on how sucessful they thought the handing in was, but don't you have to register for a leicence? So all legal owners are know already and can be checked off against the guns they have handed in, I would imagine that there must be departments of the police who deal with tracking black market unregisted guns so these could be cracked down opon. In addition you would have to make possesion of a firearm illegal, then you have to balance defending your property with revealing you are commiting a crime (will be fairly obvious if you use one and you would have to get rid of it anyway when forensics investigate the crime scene). Would also have to look at countries that have carried out sucessful ones to see if there are any little points or mistakes to pick up.If there is a lot of resistance you could make possesion of a gun attempted murder, would make people think very carefully whether they would want to carry them, especailly criminals- comunity service or light sentace for a mugging or long term prison sentance for attempted murder if they are carrying a gun while doing it, even in bank robbery they would likely think twice about the additional years.

Now if you come back with evidence that Neanderthal buried their dead, and deduce from that a direct relationship with modern man, then surely some chemical relationship has also been discovered since the advent of DNA technology, whether it it nuclear or mitochondrial similarities/connections, or one of the other chemical relationships mentioned above.

885	1	a	"MEXICO CITY – Guards and officials at a prison in northern Mexico allegedly let inmates out, lent them guns and allowed them to use official vehicles to carry out drug-related killings, including the massacre of 17 people last week, prosecutors said Sunday.After carrying out the killings the inmates would return to their cells, the Attorney General's Office said in a revelation that was shocking even for a country wearied by years of drug violence and corruption.""According to witnesses, the inmates were allowed to leave with authorization of the prison director ... to carry out instructions for revenge attacks using official vehicles and using guards' weapons for executions,"" office spokesman Ricardo Najera said at a news conference.The director of the prison in Gomez Palacio in Durango state and three other officials were placed under a form of house arrest pending further investigation. No charges have yet been filed.Prosecutors said the prison-based hit squad is suspected in three mass shootings, including the July 18 attack on a party in the city of Torreon, which is near Gomez Palacio. In that incident, gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of mainly young people in a rented hall, killing 17 people, including women.Police found more than 120 bullet casings at the scene, and Najera said tests matched those casings to four assault rifles assigned to guards at the prison.Similar ballistics tests linked the guns to earlier killings at two bars in Torreon, the capital of northern Coahuila state, he said. At least 16 people were killed in those attacks on Feb. 1 and May 15, local media reported.Najera blamed the killings on disputes between rival drug cartels. ""Unfortunately, the criminals also carried out cowardly killings of innocent civilians, only to return to their cells,"" he said.Coahuila and neighboring Durango are among several northern states that have seen a spike in drug-related violence that authorities attribute to a fight between the Gulf cartel and its former enforcers, known as the Zetas.Mexico has long had a problem with investigating crimes, catching criminals and convicting people. Reports estimate less than 2 percent of crimes in Mexico result in prison sentences. But Sunday's revelation suggests that even putting cartel gunmen in prison may not prevent them from continuing to commit crimes.Interior Secretary Francisco Blake said the revelation ""can only be seen as a wake-up call for authorities to address, once again, the state of deterioration in many local law enforcement institutions ... we cannot allow this kind of thing to happen again.""Also Sunday, Mexican federal police announced the arrest of an alleged leading member of a drug gang blamed in recent killings and a car-bombing in the violence-ridden border city of Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas.Police described Luis Vazquez Barragan, 39, as a top member of La Linea gang, the enforcement arm of the Juarez cartel, saying he received orders directly from cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes.Vazquez Barragan allegedly organized payments, moved drugs and oversaw a system of safe houses in and around Ciudad Juarez.Police said he held the same rank as fugitive gang leader Juan Pablo Ledezma, though Vazquez Barragan is not named on reward or most-wanted lists published by the Attorney General's Office, as Ledezma is.La Linea has been blamed for a car bomb that killed three people July 15 in Ciudad Juarez and for two separate shootings March 13 that killed a U.S. consular employee and two other people connected to the consulate.Police did not say when they caught Vazquez Barragan, but he was allegedly in possession of about a half-kilogram (pound) of cocaine and two guns.His arrest led to a raid on a safe house where authorities detained four suspects and freed a kidnap victim.Also Sunday, the Attorney General's Office said soldiers on patrol in Ciudad Madero in the border state of Tamaulipas seized an arsenal of about three dozen guns, 17 grenades and thousands of bullets in a house.Elsewhere in Tamaulipas, police and prosecutors raided a lot full of truck-pulled tankers in the border city of Reynosa and seized two loaded with oil of a type sometimes stolen from the pipelines of the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos. Nore than a dozen other tankers and freight containers were also seized.Mexican drug cartels have allegedly become involved in increasingly sophisticated thefts of fuel and oil from Mexico's pipelines.In the Pacific coast state of Guerrero, authorities reported Sunday they had found the bullet-ridden bodies of six men dumped in various locations, including three in or around the resort of Acapulco. Two of the dead men were identified as people kidnapped earlier in the month."
886	1	a	As I have mentioned many times in these forums, one's personal view of abortion (i.e., whether it should be prohibited or permitted) has nothing whatsoever to do with whether Roe v. Wade should be overturned. If one supports the rule of law, then they would have to support the statement made by Senator McCain. Also, given that you don't like his stated position on gay marriage (i.e., that marriage is a state issue), it appears to me that you don't like democracy either.

889	1	a	"This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture. One of the most astonising ""proofs"" if you will, that the Bible is of supernatural origin, is predictive prophecy. Science cannot, as you claim, ""explain"" everything, and it has no natural explanation for the predictions made in scripture. How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass? Also, how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people (uneducated in the ways of modern science) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today. How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently?Ecclesiastes 1:6The wind goes toward the south,And turns around to the north;The wind whirls about continually,And comes again on its circuit.  How did they know that the earth ""hangs on nothing"" when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility?Job 26:7He stretches out the north over empty space;He hangs the earth on nothing.  How did they know that the ""vapors"" of the earth rise to create moisture, that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil?Jeremiah 10:13When He utters His voice,There is a multitude of waters in the heavens:“And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.He makes lightning for the rain,He brings the wind out of His treasuries.”  Hydrothermal vents[4] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BC—more than 3,000 years before their discovery by science.Genesis 7:11In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.  Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and doesn't purport to be, nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate. In addition, many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible. It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them.The story goes ""They (scientists) are slowly working their way to the mountain's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take. After many years of research, they finally arrive at the top of the mountain, scale over its leading edge, only to find a group of theologians sitting there with the answers all along."""

910	1	a	so what is the bible then? simply a nice story-book for you to read from? if genesis is simply a representative story from which we can interpret the actions of god to mean natural selection and evolution, what about the ten commandments? it always amazes me to hear people with positions like this insist that it is okay to play fast and loose with their interpretations of genesis or the arc, but god really does hate the homosexuals. it says so in leveticus, right? so it must be word perfect truth... this bit about the origins of the earth? oh, we just interpret that as god designing evolution. but that part about people burning in hell for eternity, that's true, right?

949	1	a	i agree. i don't agree with us being in iraq but now that we shattered their security, we have to fix it again. we can't leave without cleaning everything up. that's like saving an animal in the woods from a predator and then just setting it free in the middle of new york city. we have to return it to a state where it can function on its own.
950	1	a	"*NOTE*: THIS IS NOT FOR THE WEAK AT STOMACH :*NOTE*Just read...Dear Mommy, I am in Heaven now, sitting on Jesus' lap. He loves me and cries with me; for my heart has been broken. I so wanted to be your little girl. I don't quite understand what has happened. I was so excited when I began realizing my existance. I was in a dark, yet comfortable place. I saw I had fingers and toes. I was pretty far along in my developing, yet not near ready to leave my surroundings. I spent most of my time thinking or sleeping. Even from my earliest days, I felt a special bonding between you and me. Sometimes I heard you crying and I cried with you. Sometimes you would yell or scream, then cry. I heard Daddy yelling back. I was sad, and hoped you would be better soon. I wondered why you cried so much. One day you cried almost all of the day. I hurt for you. I couldn't imagine why you were so unhappy. That same day, the most horrible thing happened. A very mean monster came into that warm, comfortable place I was in. I was so scared, I began screaming, but you never once tried to help me. Maybe you never heard me. The monster got closer and closer as I was screaming and screaming, ""Mommy, Mommy, help me please; Mommy, help me."" Complete terror is all I felt. I screamed and screamed until I thought I couldn't anymore. Then the monster started ripping my arms off. It hurt so bad; the pain I can never explain. It didn't stop. Oh, how I begged it to stop. I screamed in horror as it ripped my leg off. Though I was in such complete pain, I was dying. I knew I would never see your face or hear you say how much you love me. I wanted to make all your tears go away. I had so many plans to make you happy. Now I couldn't; all my dreams were shattered. Though I was in utter pain and horror, I felt the pain of my heart breaking, above all. I wanted more than anything to be your daughter. No use now, for I was dying a painful death. I could only imagine the terrible things that they had done to you. I wanted to tell you that I love you before I was gone, but I didn't know the words you could understand. And soon, I no longer had the breath to say them; I was dead.I felt myself rising. I was being carried by a huge angel into a big beautiful place. I was still crying, but the physical pain was gone. The angel took me to Jesus and set me on His lap. He said He loved me, and He was my Father. Then I was happy. I asked Him what the thing was that killed me. He answered, ""Abortion. I am sorry, my child; for I know how it feels."" I don't know what abortion is; I guess that's the name of the monster. I'm writing to say that I love you and to tell you how much I wanted to be your little girl. I tried very hard to live. I wanted to live. I had the will, but I couldn't; the monster was too powerful. It sucked my arms and legs off and finally got all of me. It was impossible to live. I just wanted you to know I tried to stay with you. I didn't want to die. Also, Mommy, please watch out for that abortion monster. Mommy, I love you and I would hate for you to go through the kind of pain I did. Please be careful. Love,Your Baby Girlhttp://wajclan.topcities.com/abortion/abortion.html"

952	1	a	I have not insulted you in the least. I merely speak the truth.You should try it some time.
953	1	a	Well, I define illness based upon the way medical professionals define illness, in which case, homosexuality is NOT an illness, and pedophilia is.Upon what criteria do you define illness?Upon what criteria do you judge them as wrong?
954	1	a	Yes through what is described as the heterosexual lifestyle. Besides you are very much an exception to the rule.P.S. Only homosexuals wear dungarees, and I'm Heterosexual.
955	1	a	1. You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity, by legislating the wealth out of prosperity.2. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.3, The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.4. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it.5. When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work, because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is the beginning of the end of any nation.
956	1	a	I've asked repeatedly for an example of a mutation that beneficially alters phenotype and have yet to receive one.
957	1	a	"Just out of interest, which particular aspect of ""truth"" are you getting at here?"
958	1	a	All we want is for the baby in the womb to have the same chance you did if possible.
959	1	a	Locked door sounds good to me.Are we assuming that the hijacker also has a gun? Or would otherwise it result in a duel with plastic forks and the purple thing left over from lunch?Trouble is this question leads to the next one- would you prefer to possibly have a passanger with a gun, a the hijacker almost certainly with one. Or neither having a gun?
960	1	a	The National Safety Council's new report shows that accidental firearm-related fatalities remain at record lows, and accidents involving youths continue to decline significantly. Downward trends, also being reported by other sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are occurring even as firearm ownership rises in the U.S.CDC reports a significant decline in accidental firearms-related fatalities in the U.S. between 1994 and 2005.
961	1	a	Many of the gun hating crowd also own guns. It's the elitism belief, that they're superior to all humans and thus deserve to be armed, while everyone else in the world should be unarmed and bow before them as if they're gods.
962	1	a	i'm used to reading non sequiturs from you, but how on earth you imagine this follows in any way from the post you quote eludes me completely.
963	1	a	"Yes, JP is using his usual tactic of bait and switch, starting out with a claim, and then replacing it with something that he thinks we won't notice is different.As foundit also pointed out, his statistics show ""same-sex"" households, which can mean roommates, etc. as well as gay couples, so it is likely that the actual income might be lower for homosexuals."
964	1	a	It wouldn't need a translation if it was clear from the outset. LOL emoticonXGood
965	1	a	"There's no comparing gays to murderers in anything I wrote, Kronus. That's your creation and attempt to belittle. The discussion was on TOLERANCE AND INTOLERANCE. The quote I was responding to was: ""It is perfectly acceptable to be intolerant of intolerance."" Get the drift now?"
966	1	a	Worship not money, and I will bless you.
967	1	a	Now how could I have forgotten about your lame XXX. Easily. LOL
968	1	a	nonsense! what it is a reflection of is the sense of paranoia that the hard right religious radical lunatic fringe has created ever since 9/11. if you were panicked, suck it up! others have suffered far worse and have managed to keep their perspective. the non-stop drumbeat from the chicken littles on the right is responsible for this and no one else.  cheney on meet the press  this morning is a perfect example of this destructive attitude.
969	1	a	As the founders of Darwinism/evolution introduced it as a way to make God unnecessary/get around God.

973	1	a	I drive fast, but I don't weave in and out of traffic. I treat the highways like the Autobahn. I get in the left lane and pass everybody, but do it safely. emoticonXGood
974	1	a	Well why aren't you? If you are willing to sacrifice justice for efficiency, why not take it to its logical conclusion?
975	1	a	I am frustrated because as I said before the attack on co-option requires that you keep several premises in mind and it for some reason (am guessing sub-conscious avoidance) --
976	1	a	Sorry my brain wasn't working that early this morning. What I was trying to say was I can't understand those who wish to completely take guns away from civilians. Now I think it does get a little extreme with owning several M-16s, but if I want to own a pistol, a shotgun, and some fancy automatic, well that's my right.
977	1	a	".....And really, isn't that what it is all about? Your fear of losing your ""special"" status? emoticonXRolleyes"
978	1	a	You must be thinking of Behe. Dembski originally planned to be part of the trial, but when he realized that he'd be required to testify under oath, he backed out. In other words, he is unwilling to promote his view when he's not allowed to lie or when he will be required to answer questions he doesn't want to answer. Interesting, eh?
979	1	a	hard to face the facts, i know... cant seem to get away from the fact that 3 babies die every second because of abortion.
980	1	a	4. Global warming will cause all icecaps to melt and flood the planet.
981	1	a	Perhaps you can demonstrate the link between swiss gun laws and a shooting in a swiss owned factory in missouri with an interpretive dance.

988	1	a	He has?? I didn't realize he had you on speed dial.Do you mind asking him to give the rest of us a call? Just so that he can clear up the confusion in the general populace.
989	1	a	Bush's first act as President was to hop in bed with Ted Kennedy and pass the NCLB Law. Then he attempted to appease the AARP by passing a $Trillion prescription Plan for whiteheads. If that isn't appeasing liberals and moderates, what is? emoticonXRolleyes
990	1	a	I don't know why you are having such a hard time making sense of my quotes.
991	1	a	They can.But, there's something scary to me about a huge segment of society who literally believes in something that has been proven to be inaccurate.
992	1	a	Who said anything about Voodoo?.. You honestly think because you found ONE definition for Zombie that suddenly the great gansao is right?.. How moronic can you be.

What a dumb XXXXer you are...emoticonXBangheademoticonXBanghead
993	1	a	Simple, because Israel is a non aggressive Country surrounded by 13 very aggressive Countries who not only vowed to destroy her but have combined their military forces multiple times to try just that. That isn't a theoretical threat, that's real.
994	1	a	Do you believe they (atheists) should not be allowed to display their message but the church should be allowed to display theirs?
995	1	a	your passive agressive thing is so childish. If you want to come debate with the grown ups try be one!
996	1	a	just read the following story. my question is thus, should this child be put to death per bible based rules governing a child's unruleiness?
997	1	a	"How many times is God referred to in the context of ""spirit of God"" though?"
998	1	a	Wrong - a 1 month old has human organs, a fertilized egg of say 3 weeks has NO human organs. That's the difference . This is a fact and the question is not whether the human organs are fully developed or not but the fact that there are no human organs at all in a fertilized egg of say 3 weeks.
999	1	a	I'm not trying to change your laws, I'm saying I disagree with your laws, and why. What you choose to do about your laws is up to you. I really can't understand why you're getting to het up about your laws being criticised.
1000	1	a	Considering how Symbiote has you running around in circles trying to pathetically defend your contridictions, apparently it is you who does not understand.
1001	1	a	"You need to read what people say more thoroughly, and think about it before you respond. When he said ""can"" (and there are not many simpler words than that!) It didn't mean ""will"", ""must"", or ""shall"" be more aggressive. It has been shown that in some cases it ""CAN"" happen. It may not have happened with you. It still might, we don't know. We might even say that it is not likely to happen, but we can't say that it won't, because sometimes some people do behave more aggressively when they have a gun."
1002	1	a	Why does they admin let EZ post comments like this to other people, if he can't be vicl and debate like an adult to others, why is he here......to spread god's love ...right?
1003	1	a	"I guess our little 14-year-old was humiliated beyond belief and decided it was best to not even try to respond to tons of evidence that refuted his/her ""evidences""."
1004	1	a	It is a good thing. But why must we destroy the earth and 2/3rds of humanity to accomplish it? That is the downside to the end of the age saga which is coming. You can liken it to when God poured out the plagues on Egypt because Pharaoh refused to free His people. That event will be repeated again, only on a world wide basis. And it will be in response to antichrists actions against His people.
1005	1	a	jim's trucking, A wise man once said, it's impossible to win an argument with someone who refuses to admit they are wrong. Such is your dilemma with SP. emoticonXAgree
1006	1	a	funnt i have had sex with the same guy for years and years. so have most of my friends. i think you may be taking a sterotype and applying it to all gays. doesn't work here, we know that is a lie.
1007	1	a	As for the extremely rare case where a womans life is at risk because of the baby and she has to choose between herself or the child which could result in possible death for both. Who am I to say what decision she should make. That is a horrible thing for someone to have to choose. I do know, however, that my wife almost died during pregnancy and right after pregnancy because of the baby and she would have never chose herself.
1008	1	a	Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox today threw his support behind the National Rifle Association's challenge of a City of Chicago ordinance banning possession of most handguns by filing a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court.Cox's amicus brief -- a document filed in court by someone not directly related to a case -- supports the request by the NRA to the Supreme Court for an appeal of the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in June favoring the City of Chicago.At least 33 other states support the NRA's request for the court to hear an appeal in National Rifle Association v. City of Chicago.
1009	1	a	All right, I'm not going to bother picking this apart line-by-line every day....
1010	1	a	Even better were does it say that evolution is proven?
1011	1	a	Um, no. There are many man-made substances that are not found in nature at all. And, I've never seen one of those naturally occuring skyscrapers or Ford F-150's.
1012	1	a	"I was high but I wanted your soul. I'd be good at teaching if everyone did remember to save a good high. ""No bad idea when high!"" I said one time. I knew a nice teacher for about a week... actually I didn't. There's probably attitude school because most teachers know me. (side subject, probably not different than you)"
1013	1	a	Sounds like a fact which has been blown out of all proportion - possibly by the pro-gun side attempting to ridicule it. It is a fact, however, that the presence of a gun can increase aggression levels in individuals.See other times I have brought this up, here (to the end of the thread) and here (again, that post till the end of the thread).
1014	1	a	Do I really have to spell it out for people who are just too dishonest to get it. Gun safety is a medical issue! Who has to treat gunshot wounds? I just gave an example of the Brady Center protecting rights. That is good! Others were trying to take away rights. That is evil!
1015	1	a	Very bizare, it's almost as if he's having a different conversation to the rest of us. Just trying to read through a page of this, it seems disjointed at best.
1016	1	a	No just the words I used.I am curious about the intelligible, never was a big fan of alice in wonderland.
1017	1	a	As an adoptive parent of 3 with decent knowledge of how 'the system' works, it's these annoying BS answers that tick me off. Perpetuating ignorance if not outright deciet to justify a decision to abort.
1018	1	a	If Democrats had any Brains They'd be Republicans by Ann Coulter.
1019	1	a	I don't think I've ever heard of a church that reinstated a minister after he admitted he was gay. Even upon a 'repentance'. Have you? A lot of Christians view homosexuality as a lot worse and darker sin than the Bible makes it out to be--they take that and it colors their view of a gay person as a person, which is taking it too far. Gay people are right when they say that things like divorce are a lot more prevalent of a problem; I think churches need to cool it some on the homosexuality thing and simply work on showing the love of Christ.
1020	1	a	I personally believe that abortion is murder of a defenseless, innocent, unborn infant in the womb and should not be legal unless the mother's life was endangered or possibly in the case of rape and incest........I believe it is the most barbaric act one human being can perpetrate on another........
1021	1	a	Because it is illegal to own a handgun without a difficult-to-get permit in New York,
1022	1	a	I would just want the woman to ask that question before she spreads her legs.Dono
1023	1	a	emoticonXLove Indeed, you need guns to protect your free society; of democratic ideals. So, if anyone actually takes you up on your offer, and expresses and idea, then, they better watch out if it doesn't agree with yours!That makes sense. You need guns to protect yourself from people like you!
1024	1	a	The Universal Declaration of Human RightsNothing about guns there
1025	1	a	Your selective memory is at work again. As I recall, in Waco military vehicles and equipment were used against the Branch Davidians. Nevermind the presence of members of Delta Force which was denied, at first, by the government. Then they were caught lying again about using flammable tear gas which, ironically enough, is banned by the Geneva Convention for use against enemy troops. In the end, the 'open and shut case' the government thought they had, blew up in their faces because of their lies and abuses. I also recall, at some point around the time of the Great Depression that U.S. troops were called out to quell food riots in New York, I think it was. There were a couple of young officers present by the name of MacArthur and Patton, I believe. There are a few other instances I'm sure.
1026	1	a	I think the risk from the Christian Right is less the theocracy, but that they will stifle scientific development and education to the degree that the US loses its major asset, innovation. We're already seeing this with regard to stem cell research. This isn't to say that ethics should be disregarded in science, far from it, but if the US raises a generation of kids who think science is satanic then the possibilities for development are going to be slim.
1027	1	a	I can cork a bottle of Two Buck Chuck with a cork that is 100 years old. The point is, how old the wine is, not the cork.
1028	1	a	No it f****n' isn't! If that was the case then Plessy v. Ferguson should have been used as precedent for all the following cases that dealt with segregation and racism. In Plessy the Supreme Court ruled that black men weren't entitled to the same facilities as white men, rather they had to have their own private facilities, separate from those of white men.Forget precedent, the Supreme Court should instead focus on what is truly constitutional regardless of what previous judges have ruled.
1029	1	a	Did you come up with that one yourself? Or did you have help by someone trying to silence the truth of those statements of fact? My, you did a lot of work in order to try and get me banned, to boot!
1030	1	a	"But nobody is forcing you to support anti-Catholic policies. Of course, you have the right to support them, but don't try to make it sound as if you aren't making a conscious choice to do so. That's hypocritical.When my religious beliefs bump into the law, I've never had a gun held to my head by someone saying ""support the law or else""."
1031	1	a	I had to laugh at that piece of projection. When you grow up, I'll explain it to you, s l o w l y.
1032	1	a	i read it the first time. your are trying to argue that your experience was somehow unique and the way it happened excludes you from those who do what everyone else is doing. there is absolutely nothing in your personal story that is remarkable in anyway. as i said before just because you don’t realize it doesn’t mean that it is not influencing you to do what everyone else is doing. it happens to everyone including stupid arrogant people with an i’m special attitude. your thinking is so screwed up that it precludes from knowing that. you really think your something special but you’re not your just another brain dead clone.
1033	1	a	originally posted by wsm2506: personally, i think it is the inability of mankind to accept the fact of their eventual mortality. so, they conjure up 'gods' that reward or punish with 'everlasting life' (immortality). it has been true through out history. nice observation, chum, but the real god - the god of abraham, isaac, and jacob - is alive and well and wants to see you when you die.
1034	1	a	If profits exceed 60% of your sales. There are laws against profiteering and any company that is making more then 60% profit is profiteering.
1035	1	a	The quote you mentioned in no way justifies allowing people to refuse to treat homosexuals while forcing them to treat all of those other protected groups. I do not think that point was addressed there.
1036	1	a	His reference to Marxism is to say that Nazi Germany wasn't COMMUNIST in that it didn't promote PUBLIC OWNERSHIP of the MEANS OF PRODUCTION as the USSR and CHINA did at the time. Are you completely unaware of the difference between communism and socialism? Don't the socialist countries around the world today allow private ownership of businesses? While at the same time, right now, aren't we seeing our own government promoting increased regulations in overseeing the control of these corporations, just as Hitler did in Germany? Statism is just another word for, and synonym for the definition of socialism. Here is what statism/socialism has done today to the worlds economy.
1037	1	a	...humans evolved from ape-like ancestors that lived in Africa 5-10 million years ago
1038	1	a	I don't expect you to believe anything outside of your limited range of understanding. But now I'll expect the scoffing and mocking to start, but no evidence to substantiate your ridiculous claims of soft tissue lasting 60 million years when I have just provided good evidence that it is very reasonable to believe that the soft tissue from the T-Rex isn't more than a few thousand years old at best. That dinos and in fact dragons are contemporaries of humans, not distant evolutionary descendents.
1039	1	a	Considering you left-wingers have been wearing out lawyers for the last 100 years trying to get all the vestiges of Christianity erased from our halls of government, our history books, etc., America must have been more of a Christian nation than you will ever admit.
1040	1	a	Being a Christian, she knew that killing the child would be wrong.

1042	1	a	How about a ban on J Miro in exchange for a ban on high cap mags? You cant have your cake and eat it too.
1043	1	a	No, Steeeeeeeeeeeeve, I don't see what you mean. It's a pretty lousy comparison.
1044	1	a	"You needn't be far left to support reasonable gun regulation.What current firearm related issue would drive an ""anti-gunner"" to commit a terrorist act?Or are you just lumping anyone who supports gun control in with PETA and radical environmental groups?I'd be watching for the next murderous domestic terrorist to come from the ranks of those sporting teabags. Wanna place a little wager?"
1045	1	a	i, as a creationist, do not believe in any of the five evolutionary theories: cosmic evolution: the origin of time, space, and matter, i.e. the big bang chemical evolution: the origin of higher elements from hydrogen stellar and planetary evolution: origin of stars and planets organic evolution: the origin of life macro-evolution: changing from one kind of animal into another there is a sixth evolutionary theory, but it has been proved in a controlled environment, and it is called micro-evolution (variations within kinds)
1046	1	a	Left wing media? Left wing Congress?You've been drinking the Kool-Aid.
1047	1	a	There is nothing wrong with honest intelligent debate on this issue, but the anti-gun crowd don't bring honest intelligent arguments to the table. The only thing they bring is fear and emotion driven rhetoric without any factual basis.For example, just mention the low murder rates in Canada and Switzerland, where gun ownership is legal, and they scatter like cockroaches.
1048	1	a	"This standard gets ever complicated. The 22wk old baby inside the mother has ""less value"" to you it seems. Actual location determines a value...someone else determines the value on someone. It really is confusing.

1051	1	a	Archie,But since you brought it up, do you want to back this statement up capo? Where have I ever claimed to know all that God knows? How about this from your #148 in Gay Rights:I have spoken of the coming judgment that America is facing because of our iniquity and you are proving just how deserving we are of it with your rebellious and condemning attitude towards the God who holds your very life in His hands. You are showing that you don't appreciate his Grace which He has covered America with for so long, so let's see how you feel when He withdraws His Spirit of Grace from this Country and we implode as a Nation. Why do I think that your next post will dwell on your use of the word all?
1052	1	a	And like the police , the Navy could plan and execute raids. Maybe escorts aren't the way to go. I haven't suggested they should. I am suggesting that other solutions might be more effective and less dangerous to merchant crews.

1074	1	a	i don't know if you read the last part of my post, but i'll repeat it more clearly. a baby is always reliant and demanding of another person's care. a baby outside of the womb still depends on its mother (or somebody at least) to consistently keep him fed, to help him sleep and to change his diapers. a baby can stay alive for a bare minimum of time outside the womb, but it still needs care. viable may not be the right word for you. maybe i should say as 'genuine' a baby as the newborn. and you're correct when you said: ''the probability is progressively less with each fewer number of weeks.' but that only makes sense when the womb is empty. when the womb is occupied, it is occupied with a living functioning baby.

1080	1	a	Don't be silly--no one is voting your family out of existence. Though it might make a fascinating Criss Angel or David Blane trick. This is simply about whether or not any group that wants to come along and redefine marriage should get to do so. I agree it's not an 'academic exercise', but not for the same reason you think.I no more take 'pleasure and joy' from something like this than any other public act of due process, e.g. voting to change the speed limit.Frankly, I've always thought it was pretty odd--if not downright disturbing--that some gay pride proponents seem to hold up the legality of their union as the determinant of their joy and emotion, when they are completely free to have whatever union they want regardless. After all, no one's going to block the door to the chapel, and I can guarantee you I'd be joyfully married with or without that piece of paper called a license.

I am humble enough and introspective enough to look at my own past, recognize my own human frailties, nature and shortcoming and humble myself before His perfect wisdom and knowledge to see clearly that which isn't clear to me at the time.Also, just to clarify, God hasn't told me or anyone else to kill anyone enmasse in 2000 years since the advent of the Age of Grace which Jesus, our Messiah ushered in."

1083	1	a	Cuts off man's hand, lacerates his upper body, police sayBALTIMORE - A Johns Hopkins University student armed with a samurai sword killed a suspected burglar in a garage behind his off-campus home early Tuesday, hours after someone broke in and stole electronics.Some shocked neighbors said they heard bloodcurdling screams in an area just blocks from the university. Police held the student, a junior chemistry major who turns 21 on Sunday, for several hours, but no charges were filed by early afternoon, said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.
1084	1	a	"But what you don't seem to get is that this will probably happen by default. It's not a matter of 'potential', it WILL happen in most cases unless outside intervention (killing it) takes place. That's beyond potential; that's the rule.

If you think that just as many people die from stabbing and beatings in other developed nations as people die from guns in the US then you need to do more research.

This means you are NOT allowed to kill him and once he is down you are not allowed to touch him again. Now if you have 2 criminals both with different weapons you must use the weapon one has on that one then change for the other.

1132	1	a	How do atheists account for the laws of logic in a universe without God? The Laws of logic are conceptual by nature and absolute. Being absolute they transcend space and time. They are not the properties of the physical universe (since they are conceptual) or of people (since people contradict each other, which would mean they weren't absolute). So, how do they account for them?Examples of logical absolutes are: something cannot be itself and not itself at the same time (Law of non contradiction). A thing is what it is (Law of identity). A statement is either true or false (Law of excluded middle). These are simple, absolute logical absolutes.How can absolute, conceptual, abstract laws be derived from a universe of matter, energy and motion? In other words, how can an atheist with a naturalistic presupposition account for the existence of logical absolutes when logical absolutes are conceptual by nature and not physical, energy, or motion?
1133	1	a	Originally Posted by unkerpauliethe fact is that evil and good exist, and that we can by no means use the existence of evil to conclude that God doesnt exist, because by definition the existence of evil substantiates that good exists and therefore actually supports the argument for God

1135	1	a	People who own weapons aren't responsible for combating or preventing crime in general. Gun ownership doesn't commit us to becoming default cops. What ownership does is allow us to protect ourselves in the event of an armed criminal attack. So the basis for your articles thesis is fallacious in expecting armed people to somehow become extensions of law enforcement in order to justify being armed.Therefore, the only rational response to your premise is to encourage more law abiding people to be armed and trained so as to outnumber the armed criminals so they will have no unarmed citizens to victimize. That is the most effective way to intimidate the lawless criminals into never using their weapons for violence for fear that their intended victim may actually be better armed then they are.

1139	1	a	i could care less if i shower with a lesbian. i am sure i have at the gym. one of my olderst friends is a lesbian and we have seen each other naked many times. she has never gawked or hit on me. she knows i am straight. i have been hit on by women and men i am not interested in. i say 'thanks, but no thanks.' i have only ever had one lesbian contnue after that, the number of men that wouldn't let it rest are beyond count. but overall, i think women have a lot more tact in such matters. as to the whole naked thing. we are so puritanical about nudity in the us. when i spent a month in finland i saw people of all sizes, ages, colors and genders naked all the time due to the saunas and jumping into lakes. it was in no way sexual. as far as separating men and women's showers i mostly see that as a safety issue for women. sexual assualt is a very real danger for women (1 in 3 will experience it in her lifetime). although i believe most men are not rapists, especially those in uniform, having men and women shower together has the potential of putting women in a very vulnerable situation as most men are physically stronger than most women.  i don't believe this. i am as worried about it as i am that stepping on a crack will break my mother's back. stop fretting. gay men probably find homophobes about as appealing a black woman would find a memeber of the kkk. hell, i am a straight woman and find your ignorance and paranioa of the matter decidedly unattractive.  neo-con, religious wing nuts. they are so entertaining.

That is part of what we are debating in the abortion debate.However, unlike the term person or the ideas about when rights begin, the term genocide is NOT a matter of opinion and it DOES have a very specific DEFINITIVE meaning, as defined in the definitions posted over the last few pages. I say that your claim of abortion being genocide is untrue and unsupported by logical arguement. It does not match that definition. You are the one who are spouting the importance of being definitive, yet the only support that you have given is gross distortions of the actual definition."

His main point to me was that although we know that the bible doesn't give a complete genealogical record, where it does, it is reliable. And that is what I have been saying all along too. I'm not questioning what the bible DOES SAY. I'm questioning WHAT IT DOESN'T SAY. But for the time being, until I can support what bothers me about dating the Creation of the World using genealogies, then I must concede that this record from Adam to the flood is as accurate a record as is possibly available at this time according to the bible.

1224	1	a	Of course it will have an effect on the gay marriage issue. It will prevent the people of Mass from voting on the issue and place the final decision in the hands of the Pro Gay Democratic Legislature who is owned and controlled by the Gay Lobby. It should also be noted that according to the Mass Constitution, the people have always voted on such issues. The Democratic Party controlled Government wants to change the Constitution against the will of the people who want to vote on this important issue.It's just another example of the Liberals hijacking the historical political Process and reforming it in their own image.

Multiple personalities aside, this debate over 'nouns' lasted for months. He resorted to no better argument then 'you're wrong'. A great debating style!As for debating styles....Waxy enters a debate on Science/Math says that I've been refuted somewhere else, by someone else, and then leaves; does the same thing on these Creation/Evolution debates... only adds a few insults in the process... not wishing to debate, just to name call.Mach is happy to admit he doesn't read my posts/skims over them but wants to both debate and not debate them - claiming he's got a time problem... and asks me to post stuff he's already replied toWould you count as a word-game the two incidents where you've made a claim about me being insulting, and when I've asked you to point it out, you can't?One time you were so flustered you told me you were going to warn everyone about me. You make allegations then don't back them up.Archilochus makes allegations that I don't understand the word 'chance' but is un-prepared to come up with a definition, just repeats that I don't understand it. He'll go on repeating this, because it is a replacement for debate.All the while you guys are very shy when it comes to debating each other's mistakes; such as Hank describing the world as egg-shaped, etc.In short you make so many 'just-so' statements with little recourse to evidence, in an effort to drown out anyone who differs in opinion from yourself. Hence the total unwillingness to seriously tackle anyone from your own side who is eithera) wrongorb) rudeBut in short, if someone posts here a statement, and they can't even be sure what they mean by it, then it doesn't bode well. That is what has upset a number of people; when this has been pointed out. This is also why many pro-evolutionists are so quick to resort to ad hominem here. That's what this thread of yours is an attempt at - and at best it is something that suggests only other people are guilty of this crime."

1244	1	a	It's hard for me to believe that people in your movement don't know that generally, people's view on a political/ideological issue is a different matter than whether or not they would save their life or help them. Surely you all aren't THAT out of touch with the way people are.

We have no business even talking this nonsense... gays are not some ""class"" that need to be protected. They are citizens engaging in a behavior that falls wildly short of the overall purview of not only the electorate as the existing status quo [regardless of political affiliation] but is nothing short of a deviant sexual proclivity, that... and our laws don't' exist to morally equivocate deviancy with that of the morally clear. It is a simple matter of constants vs. variables... our laws protect what you are [the constant] not who you become [the variable], what then do we say? do we create laws and burden our courts with personal subjectivity... or do we look to the objective as we have, and should continue to do so. These radical homosexual activists are literally insane to think people are simply going to let them walk all over the natural order of things in favor of a bio[illogical] behavior? The US Constitution does not guarantee the equality of feelings, nor does it behavior. People have to start clearing the closet... so to speak, and simply be down to earth and accept that not all your decisions are going to be popular ones, and homosexuality is one of them - and you certainly don't win fans by thinking you can leverage the guilt game on people even thinking you can draw comparisons between color [innate] and sexual preference [choice] as a basis for some perceived civil right, it is just plain and utter nonsense."

That agreement specified that no member of the Palestine Liberation Organization will be arrested or brought to court for any action that happened prior to September 13, 1993, the day the Oslo accord was signed, Erakat said. There was no immediate response from the United States to Erakat's claims. Soon after Abbas' capture, U.S. officials said U.S. indictments of Abbas for piracy, hostage-taking and conspiracy have apparently expired, although they could be renewed.

However, it seems to me that when we treat them with the exact same treatment as they treat us, they cry foul! Is it a False claim of trying to claim aggrieved status?

1296	1	a	'white guilt is the biggest flaw in the american psyche', says dr. david yeagley, comanche indian source: comanche_patriot —————————— white pride and white guilt today in the united states and most of the white world, as soon as a white child begins his formal education, he is implicitly told that he should feel guilt for the crimes of his ancestors. guilt for finding, conquering, enslaving, and killing off non-whites around the globe ... and littering in the process. this guilt stems not from his own crimes, but from the supposed crimes of other (dead) people of the same race. but the child is never encouraged to take pride in the amazing achievements of his race. more: white pride and white guilt —————————— white guilt, obamamania, and the reality of race supporting obama for president, like supporting colin powell a decade ago, is seen by many whites as the ultimate in white guilt repellent. i don't recall ever meeting any white person who personally felt guilty for the troubles of african-americans. but i've known many whites who want to loudly blame other whites for black difficulties. more: vdare.com: 01/02/07 - white guilt, obamania, and the reality of race —————————— white guilt = black power white guilt is best understood as a vacuum of moral authority. whites live with this vacuum despite the fact that they may not feel a trace of personal guilt over past oppression of blacks. whites simply come to a place with blacks where they feel no authority to speak or judge and where they sense a great risk of being seen as racist. one terrible feature is that it means whites lack the authority to say what they see when looking at blacks and black problems. political correctness is what whites have the authority to say about blacks, no matter what they see. it is a language of severely limited authority, of euphemisms that steer whites around associations with racism. the muteness that white guilt imposes on whites undergirds black power. it lets blacks live inside the silence of whites, and have our weaknesses be unutterable by whites even as they are plainly visible. messrs. jackson and sharpton are enforcers of white silence. and when whites are silent, black mediocrity is no deterrent to black advancement. everywhere that minorities press institutions today as groups, there is an erosion of excellence. the reason for this is that white guilt allows institutions to respond only with deference – deferring to the greater moral authority of minorities by lowering standards, and remaining mute to minority mediocrity, to save the institution from the racist label. so whites have made it socially virtuous to defer and stand aside as institutions erode. the public schools are all but devastated, universities are stunted by ideology, corporations are more unctuous than churches, the media are more unctuous yet, and american politicians – of left and right – speak in barren clichés about all of this when they speak at all. more: white guilt = black power —————————— white guilt...myth or reality? shana attends a big 12 school and is always seeing white girls her age or younger propositioned by black men who get offended if rebuffed. she personally knows of one girl who had her entire social life ruined by a black man who called her a racist at a party because she would not be alone with him. 'he said something like, 'xxxx, you just won't be wit' me 'cause i be black'.' a hush settled over the crowd and a bunch of people looked at her like she was a pariah. the girl ended up going back home when all of her dormmates started harassing her for being a 'bigot'. white guilt is when a white person feels sorry for a person of color to such a point that they sacrifice their own rights, and often their own self-respect in a futile hope that somehow their action will atone for the real or imagined sins of their ancestors. arabs had slaves. as long as the slave was not muslim it was legal. arabs were even the organizers of the african slave trade to the west. yet there is no arab guilt over slavery. the romans had their entire economy powered by slaves. and often their own people were slaves. yet there is no italian or roman guilt. and the ultimate irony about the american slave trade was that many african tribes made raids on other tribes and then sold their human booty to western or arabic slavers, yet there is no african guilt. why white guilt then? one of the reasons is the media. more: queen of succubi presents white guilt fact or myth? —————————— white guilt: today, tomorrow, and forever just recently, after declining a funding request from one of chicago’s numerous beggars, i heard a most peculiar thing. the man yelled at me as i walked away: “i’m sorry i’m not white.” at first i assumed he was talking to someone else; then i saw that he wasn’t. his tactic must have been an attempt to shame pedestrians into giving him more change. presumably, as the man did not look like a novice to this ancient profession, it must be a strategy that, with the exception of this occasion, works, which tells us quite a bit about the psyche of caucasian americans. more: american renaissance news: white guilt: today, tomorrow, and forever —————————— the myths behind white guilt - part 1. the slave trade one of the many weapons which our opponents use against us, and also against others of european ancestry, is often termed historical white guilt. those who hate us point accusingly to our empire, and to our involvement in the transatlantic slave trade with the implication that we, particularly the british and european americans, are uniquely guilty of crimes against other races. they believe that, by making us feel guilty about our past, we will be less inclined to object to what is done to us on behalf of our alleged 'victims'. more: the myths behind white guilt - part 1. the slave trade | national policy institute here is an accurate depiction of white guilt at work every day in north america and europe. .

I guess they were hoping to change the subject to something they could debate, but it didn't seem to work, now did it?Statistically, tobacco kills nine times as many people as all homicides and gun accidents combined, and alcohol kills almost twice as many as die in gun-related deaths. (src)Even if you count suicides (assuming every single one of them was with a gun, which they weren't), alcohol still kills more people. So, if your intention is to save lives, then why don't you ban this stuff? Could it have something to do with the fact that you enjoy alcohol and tobacco?

1327	1	a	"Okay, here's the hypothesis I pulled out of my rear. Long ago, some females began to wear primordial shoes. The newly evolved shoe-wearing gene was selected for, as females with leather booties were less likely to cut their feet and acquire a deadly infection. This prolonged lifespan set up a selective pressure to develop a shoe fetish among males. Males who became attracted to the booties would be at an advantage, as they would more likely impregnate the bootie women who in turn would be more likely to survive to take care of their sperm products.Your hypothesis falls apart with your first statement.We all know that it would have been impossible for only "" some "" of them to have shoes. If one had them, then you can pretty much guess they all ... just had to have them.Now you make no inference to men having shoes. Here we can agree .... Women probably did invent shoes"

Their commission is no license to impose their preferences from the bench.""If he holds to that belief than we could do alot worse.

Lawyers make excellent sophists, being able to support both sides of an argument with equal effectiveness. They can expound forever about topics they are totally ignorant about. And this is what makes Mr Johnson such a valuable resource for the creationist movement."
1396	1	a	Actually it is. You keep arguing that everyone who disagrees with you is an atheist, when they clearly are not. The rest of my signature backs that up. Furthermore, your constantly claims about your religious rightness fail due to the simple fact that your religion is not the only religion.

1401	1	a	Averages tend not to mean much when 14 kids are laying dead in a school.
1402	1	a	Apparently gay marriage is more threatening than unmarried gay couples are. The point about legalizing gay households is certainly puzzling unless one contends that cohabitation is illegal (which it isn't). But just in case I'm wrong, perhaps the authorities should be notified of all the heterosexual unmarried couples and they should be hauled off to jail.
1403	1	a	Old Allah must be schizophrenic in real life then not to know Jesus is divine and the only way of salvation (John 14:6, Acts, 4:12, etc.). Someone posted the following some time ago for more on this general subject:Mohammed v. Jesus.

1405	1	a	Isn't there some evidence that shows that the early Church was communist(notice the small c) in nature ? Where every member of the church shared a collective ownership of their possessions.
1406	1	a	Anyone who suggests abortion is a dispute between the rights of a woman and a fetus is trying to mislead you or is negligent about the nature of abortion rights. This isn't a dispute between woman vrs fetus but instead an issue between a woman's right to abortion and the interests of a small yet powerful vocal minority who believe they can project their views upon the majority. Rights are not simply just passed out but are based upon interest…something the Supreme Court based their conclusion during Roe v Wade. In the many years that have supported abortion rights I have never found a single pro-lifer who could prove, outside their opinion and others, how a fetus has an interest in being born. Unfortunately for them, fetuses have never elected pro-lifers to speak their behalf of but instead vice-versa. The pro-life movement plays as a self-appointed representative towards fetuses despite a lack of evidence or substance as to why a fetus, at the moment of conception, has an interest in living. So the debate is just whittled down to two factions; those who believe that abortion is a right provide to women or that a minority can oppress their views upon others because it happens to offend their beliefs. Women have a right to abortion because, as a nation, we have an invested interest in keeping abortion legal for them. For nearly 70 years we know that the fruits of coercion childbirth do not payoff…they lead to the corruption of law enforcement, provide criminals another avenue of wealth, wreck death and mutilation upon desperate women, destroy the healthcare system and leave behind an underground abortion rate that is rarely addressed by those who support coercion childbirth in the first place. Fetuses are immune from having an self-interest in being born because they have never developed such feelings in the sheer majority of abortion ever performed. Their brains are often far too primitive to hold such emotions or even awareness. If the fetus is incapable of feeling outraged or offended by being aborted then what is the big deal? Considering abortion was more legal during the times of our founding fathers then today.
1407	1	a	Yep I did say that and you don't know why? If you can repeal the BOR, any one of them there is nothing to stop you from repealing the Articles either is there? In fact, you have made that claim repeatedly.

1417	1	a	No, you're mixed up. You see, Superman is a fictional comic book character who was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster back in the 30s. Jesus is the true Messiah of humanity who in fact did save the World from Spiritual Darkness. He defeated death and even travelled in ways that defied the laws of physics after being crucified and presumed dead by His murderers. Jesus Christ is the real Superman. Any powers you attribute to the fictional character Superman, you can accurately attribute to Jesus and you wont find him wanting. I'm a real fan of Superman, but I love, worship and trust my eternal life to Jesus Christ. With that said, I'm calling it a night and have no desire to help you continue to mock the Lord.
1418	1	a	I've lost track of what we're arguing about here.Are we arguing about Alexander or James I?Are we arguing about whether they were bisexual or homosexual, either one of those two or both of them, or which one?
1419	1	a	Ok, we all know that human beings were created in the image of God.
1420	1	a	I agree with this but you have to remember what works in one place may not work in another and visa versa.

1422	1	a	An example of this would be an airplane for the most part. The laws are strictly enforce although they can still be beaten.

1427	1	a	Hey, let me jump in on this one.Creation science has found nothing. There are no ifs, buts or maybes, on this one. Creation science is wrong and has been proven so by the scientific community time and time again. Look at pretty much any post on this forum and you will see this. Every time a Creat brings up an argument, the secular residents of this site beat them down with logic and reason.No Creat argument has stood up to the test of science. Pure and simple.

1431	1	a	Newsweek screwed up. Newsweek should be punished by the World Court for inciting riots and causing deaths with a fraudulent story.
1432	1	a	The Mumbai massacre was an attack by Pakistani terrorists. If a country can't keep terrorists armed with machine guns and bombs from crossing its borders then you can't expect gun control to help in such situations. There might be even more such attacks in the US if the US shared a border with Pakistan.

1437	1	a	Yes, I'm so ashamed that we don't spend the majority of our national budget on bigger and better ways to kill people. Instead, we focus on humanitarian efforts. What a waste of time, money, and manpower!
1438	1	a	"The 1967 act ""...allows termination of a pregnancy at any time if there is a significant risk of the baby being born seriously disabled.""It doesn't specify what ""seriously disabled"" is: it's it left to the discretion of the doctor."
1439	1	a	You're missing the bigger picture. I don't see the conflict, BIBLICALLY SPEAKING. Because in the Kingdom of God there is also judgment. Ever read about the Israelis coming under judgment and being enslaved by the Babylonians? Why did that happen to them? BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LOVE GOD AND THEIR NEIGHBORS AS THEMSELVES. They broke the law of love. God didn't break it, they did. So, because they hated and did not turn from their wicked ways, they came under judgment. And if you read the book of Judges, that usually humbles the people and turns their hearts back to God. That's why I say there is no conflict. God's economy makes sense.
1440	1	a	Only until the GOP gets its act together or a true Conservative Party can replace it. The idea is that Conservatism works every time it is properly implemented. You have to remember that whenever Liberals have a long term stranglehold (re. New York State), there is no prosperity, only misery and an expansive (and expensive) welfare state.
1441	1	a	Hmm....some opposition to the petition...More left wing ideology at work.
1442	1	a	The Gun Control Act of 1968, which initiated the background check requirement, was written by liberal politicians; the main people who support gun control laws. It was these same gun control nuts that chose to intentionally not require private transfers to involve background checks.You missed the opportunity back in 1968, you have no room to gripe about it now. Shut up.
1443	1	a	Everything you say here is absolute horse dung where reality is concerned. Especially since I, a born again believer is here adamantly denying that I or every christian community I have ever been associated with would ever support or endorse a christian oligarchy in the USA.
1444	1	a	I don't believe it is a part of God's plan. I don't have a denomination, I simply try to follow scripture as clearly as it denotes. Most of the denominations are nitpicking anyway and it takes away from the overall.
1445	1	a	I believe you said this a few days ago.Today it was revealed that the man the British police shot and killed on the subway because he did not stop as requested was a Brazilian who had nothing to do with the terrorist attacks in London.Spoke too soon ? ....this is what comes of having a smug european superiority attitude about the americans. If the British are doing this, lord knows what the French are doing out of the public eye in France !
1446	1	a	Why? Because police cars attached to the Washington MPD's Civil Disturbance Unit had escorted the SEIU protesters' buses to Baer's home. Such cross-jurisdictional escort activity is not uncommon for both departments according to Friz and Metro Police Department spokesperson Officer Eric Frost. Still, the District police did not inform their colleagues of what was about to happen in one of their Maryland neighborhoods.

1454	1	a	it's a part of doing that with marriage though. it's a way of changing marriage.  it basically is abolishing it in a cultural sense, from what it's been defined as. that 'one iota' we're discussing is a major change: part of the very heart of what marriage is.

1457	1	a	Cold, again, is just an adjective. If you take a fish from the arctic seas, and put it in some chilled water (say, 5 degrees celcius) then that fish is going to think it is very hot, despite the fact we would call the water cold.
1458	1	a	You know, I think that you are rather an evil person, trying to create guilt where no guilt exists, where no guilt is necessary. Someone made a very important decision at a critical point in her life which made her life better and averted the consequences of a stupid mistake made by a youth. It was not an easy decision for her to make but she made it and it's well in the past, except for the people who want her to feel guilt and trauma about it.

1467	1	a	yes, you are correct. i found that discrepancy and corrected my earlier post. i had not read far enough down in the original site to have seen it when i originally posted it. that's when i also was reading the other information that i linked. it gets curiorsor and curiosor. just a week or so ago fbi revealed that they had found more undiscovered explosives in the basement of mcveigh's accomplice. it's like a replay of the keystone cops.  i can't prove this but i suspect it is a lot of this information that is not widely shared and talked about that drove bush's decision to remove saddam. if in fact saddam were implicated in the earlier wtc bombing and of course he tried to murder bush #41, then bush had all the justification in the world to remove saddam.

1479	1	a	"I think it should be legalized for medical use only (reducing the pain, nausea, and weight loss caused by AIDS). If it can ease the pain and suffering of someone, that's fine. I see no use for it other than that. What kind of society will we live in when people can freely smoke something that is 5 times more cancerous than cigarettes, causes lung damage, and pregnancy complications. It impairs motor coordination, reaction time, and it's a mild hallucinogen; great, another thing to have to test motorists for. Drunk driving isn't even under control yet, why should there be something else to monitor. It can change the brain chemistry and makes the brain more open for such other drugs as cocaine and heroin: gateway drug. I just don't think it's a good idea.Used information from ""Psychology Seventh Edition"" David G. Myers"
1480	1	a	Other than what the Bible says, I have experienced God firsthand. I have made that “contact” that we all must make in order to know Him. Even though I realize that there is much about God that I won't know until I meet Him, I still strive for that knowledge.
1481	1	a	I've got no problem with it. Geez, your not normal if you don't have it circumcised. Some woman won't want you (sexually) because of it. Babies don't remember the pain. And its not just for religious purposes, come on, the main reason is for hygienics . You could get an infection or something at an older age and have to get that done at 15-16 or so on. How painful would it be to get it then. I am happy I am circumcised, and I am glad my parents did it.
1482	1	a	Don't you get it Bassman? lyteboy can raise any issue he likes, but God help the conservative for calling him on his blatant ignorance and bigotry against anything and anyone who dares disagree with his warped view of reality. He doesn't need reason nor a rational thought process in order to attack us. All that is required is that we dare to comment at all. Like a poisonous viper he will strike out without ever considering if what he say's is either true or reasonable.

1484	1	a	amos, as frustrating as it is, we are dealing with juvenile attitudes, people whose maturity, as well as their emotional and psychological development, has been severely stunted. republicans/conservatives have morals, character and integrity and it makes it an uphill battle for us. well, when the civil war begins, i have no doubts we will win..afterall, we would be facing wimps, sissies and snivelling little brats

1486	1	a	Well sure, he wouldn't. But I doubt he'd approach torture from the standpont of anything constitutes it, either. And if someone were concerned about what constituted torture, I doubt he'd pretend it wasn't a valid question, as you're doing.How do you know exactly what Jesus would approve and condemn??? Do you now do what fundies do and claim to speak for him? Jesus said some pretty rough stuff at times. He talked about people being thrown into darkess with weeping and gnashing of teeth, and being cast into hell fire.
1487	1	a	So you respond with yet another fundie website. While it is technically correct that Kinsey thought there were only a small number of completely homosexual people, he reported exactly the same about heterosexuals - he claimed that most people were somewhere on a contiuum between homo and hetero sexuality. Surveys always underreport the number of gay people because there is still a social stigma attached to being gay. Many surveys report that even those who have engaged in same-sex activity usually consider themselves straight.
1488	1	a	I don't now, nor have I ever run away from debates here or anywhere else. The fact is that none of you have an original thought between you so I'm not here to banter back and forth anymore, but to give my opinions and move on to another subject. The reality is that opinions are all we have here so arguing minutia back and forth is a waste of time and bandwidth. I really don't feel the need to respond to the names you mooks end up calling me since I know my place in eternity, so have at it for all I care. It makes no difference to me at all. emoticonXAgree

1495	1	a	On the contrary, the Pro-lifers are acting like the slave traders. Anyone who denies a human being a fundamental human right because of a physical feature is more like the slave traders than everything. Let me also remind you that black people were sentient. Fetuses are not.
1496	1	a	because it is not so much the capitalist theory that is the problem as it is our implementation of it.
1497	1	a	"No, that logic doesn't hold Biblical mustard (or is it muster?!?!?!).Remember when Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross, and all kinds of people said things like, ""He who saved others, come down off the cross and save yourself, so that we might believe"" (that's a paraphrase). Well, Jesus Christ didn't come down from the cross and save himself: he allowed himself to die. Allowing himself to be banned from an internet discussion form seems trivial in comparison.So I'm starting to believe that the poster here named Jesus actually is Jesus Christ! emoticonXAngel"
1498	1	a	Yeppers, GW sure isn't a civil engineer and he won't listen to one word they say because he doesn't believe in civil engineering. And he doesn't believe in science, evolution, and medical evidence, come to think about it. He just believes that his is the word of God.

1503	1	a	What I would like to see is a rather antiquated method of community. Have all the destroyed housing areas razed and bulldozed to level, bare soil, then have massive 'barn-raising' house building, where the people (in that area) pitch in to rebuild each others houses (and build theirs). It's somewhat like Habitat for Humanity too, with the difference being all neighbors pitch in.
1504	1	a	"Thank goodness we have you to fix our ""problems"" for us. Maybe we should write a catechism and burn people who disagree with us. Then will we qualify as a religion worthy of your oh-so-valuable esteem?"
1505	1	a	What is the problem here? Guns or crooks stealing guns? They steal from all of society including LEOs,the military etc. not unlike the situation in Mexico. Proof is in that most of those thefts were from government sources. It is correct there is no authority granted Con-gress in Article 1, section 8 to legislate rights restrictions and recently in Heller that was reinforced.When are you leaving? :) Watch the doorknobs on the way out and all that stuff.
1506	1	a	Nice try, but no cigar. It's been widely reported, even on liberal-run media, that states with 'conceal carry laws' have had a reduction in overall crime and more dramatic reductions in specific crimes like murder, etc.Myself, I don't worry with providing 'raw data' for lazy liberals who won't be swayed in their rabid hatred of 'gun ownership' anyway. Just keep believing Sarah Brady and the rest of those fools.However, you might want to read some of John Lott's stuff:http://www.johnrlott.com/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/493636.html
1507	1	a	Creation scientists read the sedimentary record of the placement of Strata as evidence of the Great Flood while evo scientists read the same evidence very differently, as evidence of an Old Earth.
1508	1	a	So does this mean they have to get tougher on gun control or softer before the results go their way? That is the real question. My guess is that we are caught in the unhappy medium where going in either direction will be more successful than where we are now.
1509	1	a	But at no time has anyone offered any actual evidence to prove anything I have said wrong...
1510	1	a	man, you must have a hard time living with yourself. :p  you're asking me to debate in good faith. emoticonxwow emoticonxfrazzled  your anger at being challenged and being asked to provide evidence is very revealing. :p why the aversion?  if you aren't willing to answer questions or provide proof of your assertions, how is it possible to have a debate in good faith? so- you propose the topic - please make it clear and concise, and i will attempt to debate it. waxy
1511	1	a	Like juveniles, you are so easily impressed. emoticonXGood But all H-I-M proved is that throughout the false science of evo's history, intelligent people could see through it and rejected it based solely on its merits as a valid science.
1512	1	a	The reason we make maps of the universe on the scale of billions of light years is that the scientific method has led us to that tentative but evidentially robust conclusion.

The spanish inquistion used to shove a towel all the way down peoples throats wet it so it woud expand and then pull it out. They certainly tortured people at the drop of a hat however maybe they were not that upset by the heliocentric model specifically maybe it was because some people supporting the heliocentric model claimed the concept of life elsewhere.

1521	1	a	Doesn't matter, it's an attempt to redefine marriage. Marriage, by definition is a legally binding contract.And thus, has specific definitions and conditions. Therefore, it is recognized by both WHe church and civil authorities as being one man/one woman.

1529	1	a	Ok? There has also been a breakout in my high school locker room. What is your point?
1530	1	a	There is nothing at all absurd about this take. The Gay agenda has been to normalize homosexuality and what better way to do it than to indoctrinate the young and desensitize them to the negatives of the lifestyle while they're still impressionable. That way they know that within 20 years they will have normalized this abnormal lifestyle.
1531	1	a	Yeah, I know, the vast majority of the founding fathers and over 80% of all Americans are deluded, and you secularists are the only ones who know the real truth.

1533	1	a	Yes they are... the fact that most if not all graduated college and excelled in the cut throat journalism field is all a misnomer. Fact is they got the job because they're blonde and are dumb enough to repeat the right wing talking points...right? emoticonXFrazzled
1534	1	a	My two cents, Socialist: I think we've been duped by a troll. Ignoring trolls usually works well. If they are not trolls, then ignoring them may give them the time to focus and actually respond to some of the posts in an intelligent manner.
1535	1	a	Actually that's not what he said, but if we are going to bring it to gay relationships I've yet to see homosexuals campaign against heterosexual relations. I have the other way round.

1542	1	a	You should go back and learn the truth about the Crusades!* Crusade Myths THOMAS F. MADDEN What is the real story of the Crusades? As you might imagine, it is a long story. But there are good histories, written in the last twenty years, that lay much of it out. For the moment, given the barrage of coverage that the Crusades are getting nowadays, it might be best to consider just what the Crusades were not. Here, then, are some of the most common myths and why they are wrong. Source:: Click HERE

1556	1	a	I have been in several 3rd world countries, and I have never once seen a case where someone would be killed if they didn't convert to Christianity, or even if they did convert from Christianity to Islam. On the other hand, I have seen a number of cases where Muslim family members who converted to Christianity had to flee their family out of fear of death. I would be very interested in reading about or hearing about cases where the reverse is true, but I don't think there are many such cases out there. The issue of witchcraft among Christian churches may be an exception at least to the degree of people and children being ostracized.

1559	1	a	I agree wiht you for the most part. however Jews ahve not suffered very much in terms of minorities like other minorities. I do think that popelpe should take advantage of the opportunities instead of just asking for more.That still doesn't change the fact that minorities are disadvantaged due to the government's actions and negligence.

1563	1	a	what I am talking about is not a death penalty trial as we have today, but after the person has received a 100 year or more sentence. The cost would be only the method of death.
1564	1	a	Anyone who looks at this situation logically should realize that at sometime in the past there must have been a time when there was less genetic damage in the genome. – and thus, longer lives. Can anyone think of time that this may have happened? I can! The Bible reports there was a time in the history of humans that lifespans were incredibly long. According to Genesis people lived to over 900 years old.

1568	1	a	600? Oh really? Looks like the following scriptures are vague enough that they could apply to anything and nothing at the same time. Making vague enough comments can easily look prophetic. The fact that there aren't specifics is a key failure in your argument. If the bible was truly prophetic and scientifically accurate, terms that would easily be seen as represenativive of the natural force would be found everywhere, yet they are not. You are talking a little and making it to be far more then it is. Once again, anything vague enough can be taken for anything in any light under any condition.

1570	1	a	The topic did not change. The topic was the reasons for the French no vote which certain posters originally claimed was a vote against Chirac, and when I asked them to back it up with evidence. The only 'evidence' they could cite was that commentators said that, so it was so. When I said that I heard commentators saying that Turkey and fears of globalisation were the main reasons for the French no vote, then the same posters who had earlier claimed that the French no vote was a vote against Chirac now changed their tune and said Turkey and fears of globalisation were reasons as well. So please keep with the thread of this disucussion will you. I know its hard work for you but try to remember how this topic got started in the first place.
1571	1	a	I thought the US government mostly engaged in killing young black men (or rather middle aged black men once the appeals process is over), not old people.
1572	1	a	Well, as we can see from other recent posts, your reading comprehension is below high school level.I don't get it. Why do folks think lying enhances their POV?
1573	1	a	Also, a person has a change to run from those other things, admiittedly, a tossed rock can do damage, and if your opponent is especially hefty, a frying pan might fly a goodly distance, but it's the pure cowardly aspect of whipping out a gun that angers me, having a considerable advantage at a considerable distance.

1589	1	a	My God! Archy isn't even aware of the centuries of quibbling and waffling and just-so answers that have gone on among theologians about the problem of evil. It seems that he has never read Augustine, Aquinas, and on and on. He isn't even aware that there is even a name for arguments about the problem. It is called Theodicy.

1598	1	a	"That's an interesting insight.(I'm going to have to borrow that story... :p I can't help but wonder for some people if the reason they ""mature"" on the issue of heterosexual sex has to do more with the fact that they start wanting to do it themselves.A desire to partake in the action, as opposed to actual mature development, causes them to shift their attitudes towards heterosexuality.To me, that's one of the reasons Christianity (in general) has such a ""tolerance"" for divorce, which Jesus spoke out against explicitly, while not as much tolerance for homosexuality.They want to do the divorce thing or sympathize with the desire for it, so suddenly it's more ""tolerated""... emoticonXRolleyes"
1599	1	a	Problem is that the right to marry is not a clear constitutional right. It is a right that has been interpreted by Courts on an illegitimate legal theory known as substantive due process.

Every round of the military's ammo is acounted for, because they don't want them waisting their money... They can shoot as much of their private stock as they want. Also, they have very stringent guidelines on cleaning your weapons. :)

This experiment is being used to understand what happened when the big bang went bang. I think they're trying to understand how the protons formed the matter in the big bang. I didn't read the whole article, but let me try to find it.It would be interesting to see what happens. I've always been fascinated with the big bang, and we may finally start to understand much more about it and how it happened.Thoughts?

1620	1	a	Catholics have a different belief. The goal is to always save both mother and child. If the fetus dies during the attempt to save both, then that's what happens. For instance, with an ectopic pregnancy, the goal isn't to kill he fetus, the goal is to save both mother and fetus.

Just like Arch does.I counter that and use the scripture (which is good for the education in all things) to show what these 'believers' should have done.Now, if you want to actually study your bible and use contradictorary verses to support your stance, feel free.That'd just support the concept that the bible is self-contradicting.

1645	0	a	I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own -- a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotisms.A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.Scientific research is based on the idea that everything that takes place is determined by laws of nature, and therefore this holds for the action of people. For this reason, a research scientist will hardly be inclined to believe that events could be influenced by a prayer, i.e. by a wish addressed to a Supernatural Being.

1685	0	a	"Lack of a Natural Mechanism. Charles Darwin, in his Origin of Species, proposed Natural Selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple-celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today, both plant and animal. Darwin defines evolution as ""descent with modification."" However, Natural Selection is known to be a conservative process, not a means of developing complexity from simplicity. Later, with our increased understanding of genetics, it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor. However, this is theoretical and controversial, since ""beneficial"" mutations have yet to be observed. In fact, scientists have only observed harmful, ""downward"" mutations thus far. Time Constraints. Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible, there needs to be an excessive (if not infinite) amount of time. For much of the 20th century, it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed. If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred, the age was pushed back in the textbooks. In 1905, the earth was declared to be two billion years old. By 1970, the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old, and by the 1990's, the earth had become 4.6 billion years old. However, Young Earth advocates have identified quite a few Young Earth chronometers in recent years. Currently, there are approximately five times more natural chronometers indicating a ""Young Earth"" than an ""Old Earth."" Each discovery is a separate ""Limiting Factor"" that places a constraint on the possible age of the earth. For example, moon drift, earth rotation speed, magnetic field decay, erosion rates, chemical influx into the oceans, ocean salinity, etc, all constrain the possible age of the earth. Each Limiting Factor is distinct. If one were successfully challenged, there is still the problem of all the rest. Furthermore, there are Limiting Factors constraining the possible age of the universe, such as spiral galaxies where they're maintaining their spiral shapes despite their centers spinning faster than their extremities."

Yes. :) I can only speak for myself - winning converts is what the Bible suggests, but I don't believe in doing it in a forceable way. I don't believe one person / one event wins a convert all at once, it takes a combination of many tiny little steps (examples) to win converts. My main reason for posting here is political. I don't believe it's possible to have neutrality in government. If church & state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Atheism almost always equals secular ""progression"", and Judeo Christianity almost always equals tradition, according to unchanging Biblical morals. The two quickly clash in politics. Also, I don't believe future generations (school children) are having the gaps in godless evolution explained to them clearly enough. I enjoy written debates very much, and I'm trying to show how evolution can establish atheism in the U.S. government, in violation of the text of the First Amendment and intent of the framers. I believe there has to be a God because I see no compelling evidence that life spontaneously generated from non living chemicals.I was brought up without anyone forcing me what to believe, and went to church occasionally. My church attendance didn't get very regular until my late twenties - about twenty years ago. A few Bible studies, comparing it to the flow of events, the nature of people, my shortcomings, the shortcomings of science etc, convinced me. Though it doesn't really say why, the Bible says that is what will happen. See Matthew 7 :13,14. It's part of God's plan. Free will."

1711	0	a	Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement, including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture. While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally, as they would a science textbook. Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible – the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark – convey timeless truths about God, human beings, and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as “one theory among others” is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God's loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge. We ask that science remain science and that religion remain religion, two very different, but complementary, forms of truth.

1725	0	a	"O.k., lets go through your scenario. The government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed. Somehow all Americas nuclear arms were obliterated. The invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms. Now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up. The five rounds with 200 million guns, works. The population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers, though the price is high in terms of casualties. America is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place.The year is 2004, the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food. But each of the 400 million people has a gun, with lets say 30 rounds each. The population now has 12 billion rounds, and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities, and lets also assume for the hell of it, that each gun is a machine gun with long-range single shot abilities and a scope (just for fun). Same situation, same invading force. The population rises up, taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches. Lets say 2 million hand-held anti-plane missiles, 4 million anti-tank missiles and for even more fun, lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere, and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know.To overthrough the standing American army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes, tanks and naval units. First off, 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people, so you have a lot of venerable areas. Where ever the militia units try to form, they are killed by tanks, even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through America who has the greatest tanks in the world, you would have to have like 10-1 ratio on the American armed divisions. But, wait. Lets assume somehow the ground forces of well-organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population. Lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units, lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks, and the ratio of shot-to-kill was perfect. To defeat the American army of planes you would, again, have to have massive numbers (or technology superior planes). So the population tries shooting down the planes, but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground-based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles. But again, wait. Somehow, without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force, all planes are spotted (miles away) and shoot down by the UNTRAINED militia. The genius military leaders (who no body though to kill) work no doubt. Yet still, the population is defeated because if I remember correctly, the militia doesn't have naval units. So even if all the inland forces could be killed, the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force (which is very large because it had to defeat the American navy, the greatest in the world technologically).But lets assume, the population just swims to the invading ships, kills the crews, and uses the ships they stole to kill the other enemy ships. Thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the American resistance. I am actually guessing that invading force must be like 20 times bigger then America's armies for one simple reason. The only way you could defeat the American ICBMs is to have a blitzkrieg (I know my spelling sucks) like attack. Most of the ICBM silos aren't connected to the internet, mainly because the government knows the silos would be venerable to internet attack, so any rebuttal involving the virus-like disabling of the nuclear stockpile is gone.Now, you may be wondering what am I trying to say here. Well its simple, if somehow, just somehow, the entire military force of the U.S. was obliterated, it would take just one ICBM hit on the enemy's capital city to make attack impossible. Again, the blitzkrieg like attack? Even if that worked the U.S., like Russia and a few other nuclear powers, keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over, and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army. So it would never happen that the U.S. would be left nuclear-naked.But lets assume that happened (maybe during a really, REALLY cool party some idiot colonel peed on them, and they just fried). The genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air, ground and sea. You still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the U.S. probably spend several trillion doing it ( I know, that's a pretty low number for the invasion of America), and in that case most likely have satellites and long-range missiles (again lets assume somehow America's own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all America's nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event). The hugest, most glaring problem with the militia, unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop, they would have to gather. And if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in, to order to defeat the large invading army, they would be taken out very easily by 1. ICBMs launched from enemy subs 2. Prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence (remember those satellites) 3. all groups preparing for ""battle"" so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars, ambushes, rockets, infantry rushes, tank columns etc. before they knew what hit them.4. It would take a lot of planning to get 400 million people to fight, and assuming everybody has a laptop with wireless capability, they would still need satellites for the military genius in California to command units in N.Y., N.Y., and....wait America's satellites are gone and if the invading force could do that, it wouldn't be that hard to take out commercial internet satellites in geoscyhronize orbit (effectively sitting ducks). And any land based networks would be destroyed in the first few hours of insurrection. --------------------------------------------------------------------------But militia units only have guns, and they would get their butts whooped, even with massive numbers. What you are saying is only true about Napoleonic tactics, in today's modern warfare almost completely infantry-based armies are obsolete and very venerable No the afghan war is not a valid counterpoint, the terrain was different, the people are more hardened, the weapons were supplied by a military power superior to the Russians, the afghans had unlimited anti-tank reserves, had incredibly extensive cave networks in which to hide, plan and attack, only had to defeat, on the majority, other infantry battalions because of the terrain in which armoured vehicles could not cross, the Russians were under funded and their moral low, the soviets had already been beaten down by large amounts of smaller fights across the cracking Soviet Empire, china needed to be supplied with more troops as it started to look toward independence, Afghanistan is nowhere near water eliminated the possibility of naval back-up by the very crappy Russian naval forces, the afghans received help from the rest of the Arab world which would not happen with the U.S. because if an enemy can take out the U.S., it could probably take out the combined forces of Europe and North America, and, finally, the afgans didn't have nukes so they had to defend themselves with their own two hands, but america has nukes and if ever anything tryed to do what is in the above senario they would get blasted because unlike the russians in afganhistan, the americans would be defended their homeland. Neither is the French revolution a good-counter point, as I have said, your tactics only work with Napoleonic-style battles and guess what kind of battle were happening when Napoleon the 3rd was in power? (in case you didn't learn it in school, Napoleon the 3rd, napoleon's nephew, was in power during the french revolution) Trust me, cause the only thing I love more then physics is military tactics and warfare. ----As I have shown in more detail, Treat2 is right, it wouldn't work.------The other amendments don't pertain to retaining the sovereignty of the U.S.A, they pertain to the basic rights each citizen enjoys and therefore will always be important and ""In Fashion"" so long as the U.S. still has human citizens.

1779	0	a	"The militia of the Second Amendment is a militia that is described as being well regulated (regulated by both the federal government and the states as spoken of in Article 1 of the Constitution). In our own day, I think the National Guard would be the only militia that qualifies as being well regulated. Alexander Hamilton spoke of the desirability of the militia being well regulated:""It requires no skill in the science of war to discern that uniformity in the organization and discipline of the militia would be attended with the most beneficial effects, whenever they were called into service for the public defense. It would enable them to discharge the duties of the camp and of the field with mutual intelligence and concert an advantage of peculiar moment in the operations of an army; and it would fit them much sooner to acquire the degree of proficiency in military functions which would be essential to their usefulness. This desirable uniformity can only be accomplished by confiding the regulation of the militia to the direction of the national authority. It is, therefore, with the most evident propriety, that the plan of the convention proposes to empower the Union ""to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, RESERVING TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY THE APPOINTMENT OF THE OFFICERS, AND THE AUTHORITY OF TRAINING THE MILITIA ACCORDING TO THE DISCIPLINE PRESCRIBED BY CONGRESS.""The Federalist Papers - THOMAS (Library of Congress)We could go back to the days when most citizens were required to enroll in the militia, have guns and get military training- to what the Founders really meant when they spoke of a well regulated militia being the security of a free state. But the Supreme Court along with pro-gun activists claiming to be pro- Second Amendment have decided to turn their back on that part of the Second Amendment while giving the lip service to the idea of a militia."

Should fathers have to pay child support considering a mother could have mitigated the expense by having an abortion?For example: Jack is 55 and makes 20,000 a year. Jack gets injured by Bob, and can no longer work unless he gets a $1000 operation. Jack's religion or other views preclude getting the operation, so he sues Bob for $200,000, the wages he'll lose over the next ten years. Since Jack could mitigate his losses by having the operation, nost likely all he will be entitled to is $1000.So- shouldn't child support be limited to the cost of an abortion, under our current pro-abortion laws?

1836	0	a	I wasn't oversimplifying anything, only stating the obvious in that a whack job intent on murdering people can do it very effectively without a gun. But by disarming honest people as you would do, you insure that criminals who have no respect for the law will remain the only people armed in our society once the law abiding people willingly give theirs up. That will be a time to truly worry about our personal safety since we all know the police only respond to crimes committed but can't prevent crime from occurring as it's happening since most violent crimes take place in private settings.You anti-second amendment mooks simplify the issue by thinking that disarming good people who own weapons will somehow change the nature of all men. If you look at the rates of violent crimes in nations with stricter gun laws you will see that on a per capita basis violent crimes are just as high as they are here. It's just that more people die from stabbings and beatings than do here. But when all is said and done, dead is dead is dead. emoticonXBanghead

Mamère claimed that there was nothing in French law to prohibit such a ceremony, and that he would appeal any challenge to the European Court of Human Rights.French Justice Minister Dominique Perben had stated that such unions would be legally void, and called for judicial intervention to halt the ceremony.Same-sex marriage in France - Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaWhat France has is ""well, both the blacks and the whites can enter by the side-door, but only the whites can enter by the main door""We wouldn't find such an ""acommodation"" satisfactory for blacks.And furthermore, I think you would find that it's the ANTI-GAYS who have the problem with this.If Obama is able to try to put up ""civil unions"" on the federal level, you can bet dollars to doughnuts it will be the religious right who fight him.Not the gays..."

Smith's crime was especially obscene because she violated the most fundamental moral obligation of all: the responsibility a mother has for her own children. Yet wouldn't Susan Smith be exonerated by Thompson's and McDonagh's logic? These children were kidnappers and interlopers, trespassing on Smith's life, depriving her of liberty. Why not kill them? Those boys were attacking her. It was self-defense. Last year, a couple in New York was arrested when authorities learned they took a 10-day vacation to Florida and left their young children behind to fend for themselves. If McDonagh's and Thompson's arguments work, these parents should be released from jail because they bear no more obligation towards their own children than they do to strangers across town or burglars who break into their house. Those children were invading their privacy, trespassing in their home, stealing their food.

1950	0	a	"So, you think there is a God? Bad design does not equate to no design. It really is a poor argument.Much of the force of Darwin's arguments deal with bad design. I invite anyone to post any of Darwin's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of ""bad"" design. That said, consider this, your car is said to operate at 25% fuel efficiency. One could claim then the car is 75% bad design, therefore it is not designed, and if it is, certainly not by anyone of any intelligence.Your audio CD's have Reed-Solomon error correction because the read/write process is full of errors that need correcting. Cleary this is ""bad design"" that engineers would create read/write heads that make so many errors in the first place. Same with modems and host of other devices. Clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design, the designers must be clueless!Poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes. Clearly a drama (even a divine drama) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story. All the characters should be Pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending. Life and the Divine drama, like CD's and cars, are clearly not designed, or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence, because of all the bad design woven into the designs.The reason audio CD's have so many read/write errors which are corrected Reed-Solomon error correction (somewhat like us reading someone's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a CD as possible. The tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the Shannon capacity theorem.The Mp3's and JPEGS are even more ""error"" prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture, but the goal was not fidelity but compactness.A similar consideration is for the 75% inefficiency for cars. The goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost, etc., not fuel efficiency. The point is ""bad"" design, in the grand scheme of things, might not be bad design after all. The high rate of sickness and death, the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the Designer is unwise, any more than the many errors in the read/write process of audio CD suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent.Origin of Species Chapter 13:There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual. Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and in flowers, that organs which when mature become extremely different, are at an early stage of growth exactly alike. How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds. Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes? Why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern ? On the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these questions.Homology was a pre-darwinian idea with the term coined by Owen who rather despised Darwin and his ideas.Darwin tries to argue why a Designer would not use the same for the same function. He says homology is evidence of an unwise design. The premise is a Creator wouldn't be so inefficient.But, unless one has a handle on the teleological goal, one is free to fabricate all manner of ""bad design"" arguments (for example read/write errors in audio CD's or fuel inefficient cars). The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life, and that life could not have evolved. Like a great novel, the ""imperfections"" of biology are part of a larger plot.It is turning out, Darwin's argument from homology is a concept in crisis."

If I see a light on in a room, that is an empirical observation, and for me, that the light is on, is an empirical fact. However, if you and I both empirically observe at a fetus in a womb then the only empirical fact we could both agree on, I think, is that there is indeed a fetus in a womb. I say that fetus is part of a persons body performing a function, you say its something else, and that's a mater if ideology, not mere observation.

It's not that mental existence is irrelevant ... quite the contrary; in fact it's the reality that there will SOON be mental existence that makes it matter. I don't think the issue of abortion should ever be divorced from the reality that the embryo will likely grow into a human being ... a human that is human by pretty much anyone's standards. So I suspect that the big difference here is that pro-choicers are more ""in the moment"" in terms of the way they view the fetus, and pro-lifers are more ""long-term bigger-picture"" in terms of the way they view the fetus. Certainly the likely potential of what the fetus grows into has a lot to do with the pro-life position on whether it is truly human."

This is a brief outline for a clarification of the discussion of this issue. > (1) The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution does not establish the right to keep and bear arms. None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any ""natural"" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or ""self-evident"", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed ""natural rights"" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea > (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government. This was clearly the understanding and intent of the Framers of the U.S. Constitution and was a long-established principle of English common law at the time the Constitution was adopted, which is considered to be a part of constitutional law for purposes of interpreting the written Constitution."

2088	0	a	"There's just enough truth in that statement to keep me from saying it's false, but if I analyze it, it will help make my point;The word ""evolution"" has such a broad meaning that it doesn't have to mean atheism, but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview, that's what it often DOES mean. If it shouldn't mean it, but it is used so that it does, then that's what it actually means.Creationism means religion, but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years. That's not just religion, it's secular, observed history - something evolution doesn't have. So if a person hearing your statement doesn't consider it carefully, it's very easy to be mislead by it. It implies that ""evolution"" (the branch that declares that the book of Genesis is false) is somehow a secular, observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion, a superstition. Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.The problem is, a school teacher can make the statement you made, and it can't be legally questioned by anyone. Yet there was a case that I read about somewhere, where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution ""with an open mind"", and an ACLU lawsuit ensued. Of all those likely to be mislead by your statement, it's young impressionable school children. Publicly paid school teachers misleading them with statements like that, without a full explanation (prohibited by the courts) does get an establishment of atheism started. It's what I mean when I say that when church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Maybe government could be neutral, if it was small. The U.S. government is no longer small. Do the Christians that you know that believe in evolution, believe that there was no first man named Adam, or that there was no Genesis flood? The term ""evolution"" needs to be narrowed down - more clearly defined, for these discussions."

2107	0	a	"Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- On January 22, 2006, the New York Times reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from Pakistan's tribal areas, which has been called ""the most dangerous place in the world."" A week before that, the CIA fired missiles remotely from a Predator aircraft into the Waziristan tribal area. They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives. Instead, they killed 18 women and children.One week before that, I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel, the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas, where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns.Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible. It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar. They repeatedly denied us entry because, according to them, the Pakistani Army had too many ""sensitive operations"" going on in that region. Without my personal advantage (a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province), we never would have gotten in.The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi. He was born and raised in the tribal areas. He took care of us while we were there, and he was a godsend. You can't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem.Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center, where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia, six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms. They became our personal bodyguards, and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories, barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day. Most of the work is done by hand.The vendors are Pashtuns, who are basically the toughest people in the world. They comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late '80s.These days, the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the Taliban. They purchase the guns, then cross the border to fight the U.S. army in Afghanistan, or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the Pakistani army.This summer, I went back to Pakistan, and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter. The Pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas, attempting to eradicate the Taliban and al Qaeda. The U.S. and British troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers, where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations.But at the same time, there is a cultural explosion taking place, a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere. The whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government.For Pakistan, it's a volatile, turbulent, and fascinating moment in time."

2144	0	a	I disagree. Well maybe technically. Let's look at it this way. Criminals' access to guns may even go slightly up, because there are SOME criminals who may not want to obtain a handgun illegally. But the access of innocent citizens will go up way more than that of criminals, thus less criminals will want to commit a robbery or something with the fear of the person living there owning a gun. Criminals may forget getting a gun anyway so maybe indirectly, but the major problem is access to guns, not ownership of guns. Access will go up, no one disputes that, but people using them for self-defense goes much higher so that more than makes up for the increase in access for criminals. Make sense?

Or the Federal Government could pass one law to require a waiting period throughout the nation. It would count as one law but would have more of an effect than 100 separate city laws.

2179	0	a	"Court: Seattle police OK to stun pregnant womanBy GENE JOHNSON ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITERSEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket, a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent.Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone. She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding, and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she'd be admitting guilt.Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way, the officers decided to arrest her. One reached in, turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor. Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant, but refused to get out, even after they threatened to stun her.The officers - Sgt. Steven Daman, Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times, in the thigh, shoulder and neck, and hauled her out of the car, laying her face-down in the street.Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later, but has permanent scars from the Taser. She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights, and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue. He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks' rights were clearly violated.But in a 2-1 ruling Friday, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest.The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed, Hall wrote: ""It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment's notice. Nonetheless, some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained, particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation.""They also noted that the force used wasn't that serious because the Taser was in ""touch"" mode rather than ""dart"" mode, which hurts more. They reversed the lower court's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit.The officers' lawyers, Ted Buck and Karen Cobb, said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced.""Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders,"" Buck said. That's all the court recognized today. The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances.""The majority's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon, who called it ""off the wall.""""I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks, let alone three activations of a Taser, in response to such a trivial offense,"" she wrote.She argued that under Washington law, the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody: Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense, and it's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest.Berzon said the majority's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves didn't make that legal argument. To obstruct an officer, one must obstruct the officer's official duties, and the officers' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her, check for warrants, write up the citation and give it to her. Brooks' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties, she said.Furthermore, Brooks posed no apparent threat, and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus, or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable, Berzon said.Brooks' lawyer, Eric Zubel, said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case.""This is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman, in front of an elementary school, at 8:30 in the morning, to someone who posed no threat whatsoever,"" he said."

2192	0	a	Hi SS. Causing trouble again? :)The cat experiment you describe cannot, unfortunately, be used to support Lamarckian inheritance, because all the animals were denied the same essential nutrients, both the parents and the developing cats in the womb. Logically, if lack of nourishment causes health problems in one generation it's inevitably going to cause the same problems in the next even without any evolution taking place. As others have pointed out, this experiment is evidence that adaptation to that restricted diet was not happening. Had the cats initially suffered and then begun to get better, this would be strong evidence that adaptation was occurring.Similarly, if you were denied Vitamin C you would develop scurvy. If a pregnant woman was denied Vitamin C - well, it hardly bears thinking about, but the fact the baby - were it to survive at all - would undoubtedly also suffer from scurvy is readily explicable by the observation that it, too, was denied Vitamin C.Now, if the baby was born with a functional Vitamin C synthesising gene, that would be compelling evidence that organisms could intelligently respond to environmental changes.

But I'm also not saying it never is, either."
2202	0	a	There are a few fictional works which addressed this possibility and brought up interesting points. One is Aldous Huxley's book Brave New World. In it, people were grown in artificial wombs, not born, and they could be genetically designed. In the book, a high level official of this society mentions to the main character that an experiment had been tried in which all the people made were brilliant, athletic and beautiful - anyway, characteristics that we admire in people (nothing was said about picking their moral character). They ended up killing each other in competition for the better jobs and for leadership since nobody was willing to play the subservient menial role. Therefore, this society purposely grew humans who were at different levels (some very mentally deficient) to supply a distributions of people who could fit the distribution of roles necessary for society.Therefore, on an individual level, I don't have much of a problem with genetic engineering (assuming that we really fully knew what we are doing, which is doubtful since many unforseen side effects could occur). However, on a societal level, it could be very problematic.

While plate movements are related to the Earth's core heat, the necessary heat to have that much movement would mean the Earth's core would have to be hundreds of times hotter. That's way more then the surface of the Sun.

Because in order to mantain a healthy environment for children.(which they always seem to want to adopt) there has to be a healthy relationship. Now a child grows up, and sees two men/women dating eachother. That can confuse the child as to whether they should also be gay. It is not only harmful to the family environment, but also to society. And don't hand me that,"" My uncle is gay."" Stuff. I had(he passed away) a gay uncle, have three gay cousins, and a gay aunt. Not my whole family is not gay, but it seems like I have quite a few in my family. Now I don't support what they do. Even though I love them because they are my family, I would not support them if they were to marry."

2247	0	a	One reptile has a type of third eye, but it isn't for sight nor is it permanent. It is used to absorb vitamin D from the Sun for the first 6 months of life in order to help it grow into a healthy adult. Then it is covered by scales. Tuatara Fact Sheet But the question persists as to why it seemingly devolved the need for that third eye if it originally had 3 working eyes? I mean, it didn't simultaneously evolve a poison gland or some other form of defense to replace the need for it.Now let's look at some insects which you will invariably mention as flaws in my argument. They too have extra eyes called ocelli, not working eyes mind you; and neither do they aid in sight but the ocelli are simple structures and are believed they only detect light levels and movement. Now why would evolution not give vulnerable flying insects perfect vision when they have allegedly had literally hundreds of millions of years and many reasons to evolve it? Are you aware that the visual acuity of insects is approximately 1% of that of humans? And we all know that humans don't have the best eye sight in the animal kingdom. MICROSCOPY-UK / MICSCAPE - Insect insights. Insect eyes. Honeybee legs.What really distinguishes evolutionists from creationists is that creationists will ask the questions fear to ask since this fraudulent gospel has so many inconsistencies which can't be reasonably or rationally answered, they refuse to even consider them. Keep in mind that I have pointed out scientifically documented realities about what exists within the animal kingdom, but what I will get back from you are what ifs and maybes regarding these inconsistencies. Why is it that you never look at what is evolutionary dogma and ask why if random mutation happens based on environmental, social and predatory pressures, hasn't it made more diverse selections where needed, as in a working third eye in the back of animals heads, rather than in all cases follow a proscribed formula which exists today, just as it existed in the oldest fossils ever collected?

""There's no second chance."" Previously, Green says, molecular biologists thought the ribosome tightly managed its actions only prior to the actual incorporation of the next building block by being super-selective about which chemical ingredients it allows to enter the process.Because a protein's chemical ""shape"" dictates its function, mistakes in translating assembly codes can be toxic to cells, resulting in the misfolding of proteins often associated with neurodegenerative conditions. Working with bacterial ribosomes, Green and her team watched them react to lab-induced chemical errors and were surprised to see that the protein-manufacturing process didn't proceed as usual, getting past the error and continuing its ""walk"" along the DNA's protein-encoding genetic messages.""We thought that once the mistake was made, it would have just gone on to make the next bond and the next,"" Green says. ""But instead, we noticed that one mistake on the ribosomal assembly line begets another, and it's this compounding of errors that leads to the partially finished protein being tossed into the cellular trash,"" she adds."

But as you said, we have two extremes to choose from, and SCOTUS chose the one that doesn't take into account the woman's health for this particular procedure. I'd also add that because this is a late term procedure, if health is the reason to not take the baby to term, then caesarian delivery very well might be an option, in many cases.

These men were inspired by Jesus, God, how can you argue that he is not the christ? The odds of one man filling all the prophesies is impossible. And these scriptures have been unchanged for the past 2000-2500 approx years! Thats proof for me that Jesus existed and that he is God. PM me if you like.

Therefore on a personal level I have no hope of changing anything. Things were, are and will continue to be this cycle of events. As this applies to biology any other life sciences. My actions are only the result of my animal instict. I am not playing the inner - child but rather the inner - beast. No law is passed to keep a beast in submission to another beast. Governing bodies fail if there is no accountablity. That is the cruix of the discussion. I am accoutable to God. If I am wrong about creation, I have only missed out on a lifetime of animal behavior.

When one dies, who inherits? If one is incapacitied, who decides what the treatment should be? Basically, pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two, so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task, and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious. If we're talking about legal recognition, and we are (right?), then the cases are wildly different. Our marriage laws, for better or worse, are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household. They also assume man and wife, true, but don't actually depend on that. But the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws; changing that is a huge project.

Liberty unfettered by morality is the operative rule of anarchy, not civilization. At any given moment, each of us is constrained by hundreds of laws reflecting our moral responsibilities to our community. The most primal of those rules is the obligation of a mother to her helpless child. This is one of the reasons the public outcry against Susan Smith was so intense.

Actually it does less damage to the brain then alcohol and it cannot kill you. It is impossible. It takes 20,000 joints in one sitting to overdose on marijuana. Alcohol however kills thousands of americans each year from alcohol poisoning. You know that idiot pothead. He didn't get dumb from pot, he got dumb from birth. Marijuana does not have long term effects on IQ. The only side effect is the lazy side effect. The day after a person tends to be more lazy however it is like a hang over..... it only lasts for a day. There is no reason why it should remain illegal.I also support all drugs being legalized because the drug war has failed. We spend billions each year on the drug war and I can call someone right now and pick up some crack. It is a failure. What we should do is make it government controlled and then spend the money to fight drugs on drug education. Flood the schools with ACTUAL info about how herion kills and how it breaks a person down. Tell the kids how you can die from one use of coke. Tell them the short term and long term effects of each drug. If we can educate our kids and even adults through an ad campaign about what drugs do to you then we could save far more people. Also allowing drugs to be regulated will lower the prices and effectively kill drug dealers and gangs off the streets. There are so many benefits to legalizing drugs. Anyone want to fight it? I have proof to back up what I say and also have the effects of each drug."

Perhaps this should be posted as a poll but I wonder if this support for ""choice"" remains consistent.Do those who support the choice of abortion also support the choice to bear children? Do they abhor the imposition of the one child rule on the women of China for example? The woman's choice is restricted and the ideals of the government are imposed upon her. Do those here who support the freedom of choice of abortion denounce China's policies and support the freedom of choice of bearing children?There are also some areas in India where a person running for an elected office cannot have more than two children (there are obvious implications of this policy on what the makeup of the ruling government will be and how it will institute policy). Do those supporting the choice of abortion denounce this policy as a restriction of choice?Or do environmental and population concerns outweigh and assume more importance than the freedom of choice in the above examples?"

Specifically the sun's energy provides all that is necessary to transform inorganic chemicals into a living cell and eventually into people. All that is necessary is an open system and abundant energy, especially the sun's energy. If complicated living organisms can be created in this way, certainly something not nearly so complicated as a house could be produced. Especially a solar-powered house!

Almost four months later, police mounted a search of the premises and confiscated a dozen items, including a script and a DVD of the show.Critics accuse the police of being overzealous and question their motives, but law enforcement officials remain unrepentant.Shiga prefectural police regard the incident, in which a hunter with a gun permit allowed TV personality Noburo Harada, 57, to momentarily handle the rifle during the show, as a serious breach of a law concerning the storage and management of firearms.So much so, in fact, that on June 12, the prefectural police referred the case to prosecutors. As a result, the hunter, aged 49, along with a 60-year-old TV producer and a 37-year-old director of the show, could face charges of violating the swords and firearms control law.Police did not pursue a case against Harada even though he briefly handled the weapon. Police argued that he did not actually ""possess"" the rifle because the hunter handed it to him in an unscripted moment during the broadcast.Police justified their search on grounds that they needed to determine if the law concerning the storage and management of firearms had been broken.The show, called ""Tokimeki Shiga'S,"" is broadcast one Saturday a month. In the show, Harada visits various locations in the prefecture as a travel guide.The program in question was set in Yogo, where Harada and other cast members were served a pot of wild boar meat. The hunter who had killed the boar appeared in the scene. He offered the unloaded weapon to Harada and asked,""Do you want to hold it?""Harada held the rifle and commented, ""It's heavy, isn't it?"" adding, ""Not everybody has a chance to hold it, right?""He held the firearm for six seconds and then gave it back.Biwako Broadcasting says the scene in which the hunter handed over the rifle was not in the script and was improvised.The TV crew decided to display the rifle on the show after the hunter told the director he had no problem with the idea at a preliminary meeting.The prefectural police began their investigation after a complaint by a viewer.The intervention by the police flabbergasted Harada and employees of other TV stations.""I never could have imagined anything like this,"" Harada, a former member of the male comedy duo Anonenone, told reporters after he was questioned by police on June 2. ""I was stunned.""Akihiko Ito, head of the TV station's programming department, said the station would cooperate with police, but defended Harada's actions.""We consulted our lawyers, and it is hard to believe that touching a rifle for about six seconds is equivalent to possessing it,"" he said.A spokesperson with a TV station based in Osaka sharply criticized police.""They should have at least asked (Biwako Broadcasting) to cooperate voluntarily,"" a spokesperson said. ""From a common sense standpoint, we cannot even comprehend what the police were thinking.""An employee at another TV station was also critical.""If we, for example, were to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor picked up a large knife, would the police investigate us, too?"" the employee asked. ""Such an overreaction would be intimidating toward people trying to do their jobs. This would ultimately undermine viewer interest in programming.""But police say they don't understand what all the fuss is about. They say the media has, by focusing on the celebrity angle, blurred the facts in the case.A senior official with the Shiga prefectural police said the real issue is not that Harada briefly held the rifle, but whether bringing the rifle to the live broadcast was appropriate in terms of ""storage and management.""An explanation for the police tactics may lie in the revised gun control law, which took effect in January.The law was tightened after a 37-year-old man in Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture, shot and killed two people and wounded six in December 2007. The man, known for erratic behavior, committed suicide after the shooting.The incident called into question whether existing regulations regarding gun permits and firearm storage were adequate.""I believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the TV crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said.According to the National Police Agency, police can file a case against anybody if he or she, with criminal intent to kill or injure people, possesses a weapon for even a second.A case can be built based not on the length of time of possession, but on the purpose of possession, the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect tricked or maneuvered the gun owner.The Shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the grounds that they had to find out how it was possible to bring a gun to the show.By transporting the gun to the show, the hunter may have violated the rules under which he was granted a gun permit, police asserted.They defended questioning Harada and the crew as crucial to ferreting out the real issue--did those involved in the program improperly store and manage the weapon?Takaaki Hattori, professor of media law at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, says that police went too far.""The way the police conducted their investigation is not convincing. I sense they were trying to use the media to sell the public on the revised gun control law,"" he said. ""They should have been more cautious about the exercise of power by public authorities.""But he also said the broadcaster could have been more prudent.""The TV station should consider whether it was absolutely necessary to use a gun in making the show. The gun owner may have been primarily responsible, but the broadcaster is also to blame for lacking awareness of the law.""Takaaki Matsumiya, professor of criminal law at Ritsumeikan University School of Law in Kyoto, disagrees that the TV station or the hunter were in any way culpable and lays the blame on the authorities.Citing a precedent set by the Tokyo High Court in June 1967, he said: ""The high court decided that the act of touching a handgun for dozens of seconds by a man brokering the sale of a handgun during the transfer did not constitute 'possession,'"" he said. ""There have been no precedents to alter that interpretation. Harada did not 'possess' it (during the show).""Matsumiya also defended the hunter who brought the rifle to the set.""When the precedent concludes that a person 'has no legitimate reason' for bearing and carrying a firearm, it assumes that he or she was going to do harm or ran a risk of doing harm,"" he said. ""It is obvious that was not the case under these circumstances.""(IHT/Asahi: July 2,2009)Now then, what's all this bull**** about how other industrialized nations are better off with regard to guns when compared to America? I don't see such being the case, do you? If you can't even touch a gun that somebody hands you to examine without breaking the law, that is a serious violation of human rights and everything else.How can Japan be so much better off than we are, if it's a crime for somebody to hand you a rifle to look at but not to keep; especially when it's unloaded!?"

While God could certainly intervene in the natural process (called a miracle), to make God responsible for common natural phenomena means that as each scientific discovery finds a natural explanation of what was previously attributed to God, the direct intervention of God becomes unnecessary. That is, as the gaps in knowledge become smaller, the God of these gaps becomes correspondingly smaller. People with this mentality see science as a threat to their faith. Obviously, were such a view held by the founders of modern science, there would have been no incentive to find answers to the natural phenomena. Understanding these natural phenomena as secondary causes, places God above them where increased ability to explain how they occur not only does not ""decrease"" God, but adds wonder to His creation."" http://www.leaderu.com/offices/o_hel...dor_faith.html"

Since I do not want to misrepresent the theory, I have used an explanation of Darwin's theory from Gould's book, ""Full House."" On page 138, Gould states:1) All organisms tend to produce more offspring than can possibly survive.2) Offspring vary among themselves, and are not carbon copies of an immutable type.3) This variation is passed down by inheritance to future generations. (We know that black folks have black kids; white folks, white kids; tall parents tend to have tall children; and so on.)4)If many offspring must die (for not all can be accommodated in nature's limited ecology), and individuals in all species vary among themselves, then on average survivors will tend to be those individuals with variations that are fortuitously best suited to changing local environments. Since heredity exists, the offspring of survivors will tend to resemble their successful parents. The accumulation of these favorable variants through time will produce evolutionary change."

In my view, abortion is murder, one way or the other and rare extreme cases don't justify its legality. Even the rape victim gets a better chance than the baby does. They're at least alive while they kill their baby. That in itself will eat at the person for years until they find some way of forgiving themselves.I believe these testimonies to be real, and I feel sorry for those victims who feel obligated because of family relations' reputations to kill their own child. It really is sad.

2468	0	a	"In 1927, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. declared it ""better for all the world"" if the ""manifestly unfit"" could be stopped from reproducing. ""Three generations of imbeciles are enough,"" he famously wrote in his ruling in Buck v. Bell, which affirmed the constitutionality of forced sterilization of people deemed genetically inferior. . . . in the mid-1800's . . . the British polymath Sir Francis Galton . . . introduced the idea of intelligence as an inherited trait and . . . developed a science to promote it, which he named eugenics. In America, Galton's ideas were picked up by the biologist Charles Davenport, who in 1904 established Cold Spring Harbor laboratory on Long Island as a national center for eugenics research and policy planning. . . . Davenport created a Eugenics Records Office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named Harry Laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the ""germ-plasm"" of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated. Laughlin became an influential developer of American compulsory sterilization policy, which had officially begun in 1907 when Indiana passed a law allowing scientists to use surgical methods to eradicate the unfit . . . .He helped Congress formulate the 1924 Immigration Act, which kept out ""inferior"" people from Southern and Eastern Europe. Bruinius deftly plays up the contrast between the eugenicists' obsession with cold measurements of human value and their own messy lives, which were marked by disease and behavior that could have qualified them as unfit: Galton suffered from severe depression; Davenport had one child who was sickly and another who was apparently dyslexic; and Laughlin was afflicted with epilepsy. In America and elsewhere, enthusiasm for eugenics was broadly supported by elites. In Britain, people as varied as Winston Churchill and George Bernard Shaw embraced its goals, and there was lively debate about how much the state itself should control reproduction of individuals. Eugenic science especially appealed to Fabian socialists, who saw it as further justification for abolishing class — after all, once the playing field was level the effect of heredity could finally express itself clearly and be studied. In this country, eugenic theory and practice engaged the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, the birth control crusader Margaret Sanger and leaders of the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations. It galvanized temperance advocates, suffragists, and liberal American churches and synagogues. Citizens enthusiastically entered ""Fitter Family"" and ""Better Baby"" contests."

No, not at all. Remember, the works which became the new testament were around for centuries before they were actually compiled into the Bible. And none of the originals still exist. Who knows what changes were made to the account of Jesus's life before they were finally compiled. For example, look at Matthew 10:34 ""Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword."" Doesn't sound much like Jesus, does it? It certainly doesn't fit into the picture that's generally painted of Jesus. In the end the New Testament was written and compiled by mistake prone people. Some may believe that it's the unadulterated word of God, but looking at the above passage it's also easy to believe that it's also the work of common people.The rest of the paragraph rather depends on accepting that line, and I believe I've shown that a reasonable person might not, so I'm going to skip to your next paragraph."
2509	0	a	I think his point is paulie, that if evolution is actually as evo defines it, as changes made by way of random mutations, then why doesn't life reflect those random mutations? For example, why haven't a large number of lower animals who live their lives being hunted by carnivores adapted eyes in the back of their heads as a needed early warning system to see their stalkers coming from behind them?Especially in times of drought and famine when food is scarce? The environmental pressure exists at those times to justify such a change, yet from fish to birds to reptiles to mammals to even insects, most every creature in creation has 2 eyes, 1 mouth, 2 ears, (if they even have ears since some animals use vibration sensors to locate the movement of prey and predator.)It makes sense that Eagles, Hawks and Falcons have only 2 eyes since they are apex predators which rule their skies. But they regularly swoop down on smaller birds and pluck them out of the sky for food for their young. So why haven't smaller birds found the need to evolve eyes in the back of their heads?

2521	0	a	i'm not exactly sure your point with this article. was it merely to show that pro-choice groups exaggerate claims? that they use emotional rhetoric to sway people to their side? trust me, you have told me nothing new. in fact, i am somewhat amused that you pointed this out, given that pro-life groups are guilty of all this and more. it said: although the thought of finding a deceased young woman with a bloody coat hanger dangling between her legs is -- to say the least -- unpleasant, powerful and emotionally charged rhetoric does not a good argument make . i almost peed myself laughing when i read this. whatever powerful, emotional images you believe pro-choice are guilty of, pro-life groups are many times worse. what is the mental image of a deceased young woman compared to the physical picture of bloody aborted fetus'? i have seen pro-life groups holding huge posters outside high-schools, and pro-life groups hold them up in front of clinics. how much do you want to bet that the fellow here would defend one while attacking the other? the article speaks of fallacies yet fails to mention the statement of 'abortion is wrong because it's murder!' that pro-life people seem very fond of. this is the exact fallacy the article mentions, using an unproven point (abortion is murder) to hold up an unproven point (abortion is wrong). i point this out not to absolve pro-choice groups of guilt, but to say: before pointing fingers, make sure your own house is in order. this entire article is also something of a strawman argument as well. the argument that illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortion is banned is not a justification for legal abortions (per se). as i see it, since illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortions are banned, the complaint is that pro-life people would rather see more women hurt (and yes, more women are hurt with illegal abortion than legal) than actually solve the problems with society. to ban abortion and declare the problem solved is extremely irresponsible and does nothing to help society or women.  if you would, chloe, please link to the study the article mentions about the number of illegal abortions? i’m amazed they managed to eek out numbers, given that not even the cdc has exact figures since illegal abortions were not tracked. the most compelling evidence i’ve seen looked at the birth rates for various ethnic groups the years previous to abortion being legal to the years after, corrected for various factors such as better birth control methods. they found little change in the birth rates, indicating the number of abortions most likely did not increase or decrease. yes, i know pro-choice groups mislead with stats and figures. this is nothing new, but i feel it is dishonest to point this out without acknowledging your own groups shortcomings in the same area.

Or are you saying that God has a big imperfect copy machine that he jumps into and out pops an imperfect copy.My thought was that God was the direct agent of creation (without the use of intervening mechanical devices), and being a perfect Being incapable creating imperfection (for then He would not be God), all of His creation would be as perfect as He is.So does this perfect God have a spine that is a plethora of engineering disasters?

So we have shown that we ourselves produce offspring but we are put here and given the abbility by God to produce offspring. As far as your question on why God alows addicts to have babies it can be explained as this. We where given the freedome of choice to decide if we want to be an addict, wrong put we have the choice. God created us to have that choice, or else we would be robots. The bible also says God knows everything yet to come, so he new that this particular person would become an addict and have baby. God can stop this put he doesnt interecpt dirrectly with our choices.

2591	0	a	To apathy:Call me crazy, but I still don't see any evolution in the peppered moths!! We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution, we now still have light and dark moths. The only thing that has changed is the population ratio, assumably by *natural selection*. Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means. Creationists recognise it and accept it as it goes in nicely with the creationary model. Natural selection is basically the death of a particular type of animal if they are unsuited to the environment. In a given environment (e.g. a very cold region), some (e.g. the long-haired dogs) will be more likely to survive, and so pass on their information, than others. Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information. An example, consider the cold environment mentioned above. We take a population of both long, short and medium, haired dogs to this environment. Over time, very short time, the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions. So, as a result, the population as a whole has lost the information for making short haired dogs and has not gained any new information. What did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment? Dogs (varying in hair sizes). What did we get after a short amount of time? Dogs (only the long hair size). There is no evolution occuring here, we had dogs before, dogs after. The only difference is that the gene for making short hair has been eradicated from the population by natural selection -- that is it. This is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the Biblical account of our origins, i.e. variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.So even if the peppered moth case was really true, and not a fraud, it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation. Anyone who says other wise, does not really know what they are talking about unless new genetic information is somehow being added to the moth's total DNA content, i.e. their genome, in which case you might have a point.Would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept? His method appears to be good, i.e. using observations and experimental data, as well as repeatability. He is using the scientific method (in reverse as he is collecting the observations and experimental data and then will draw a conclusion based on the evidence and possibly his own bias. This is yet to be determined, however. Can you keep us informed of his progress?

Almost all of God's followers were spoken to by him and were given visions and angels to tell them what to do. I don't believe it was considered incest till the law was written abolishing that sort of thing.I'm not sure about him creating other women either, but you could be right. After all, I've found the idea of him creating life on other planets AFTER the creation acceptable (still wondering about the end of the creation where he stopped though) so with that view in mind, I suppose it's possible.
2604	0	a	For this to be a consistent pro-choice argument, and assuming this to be a rightful interpretation and application of the 14th amendment there would be necessary conclusions. Those who hold this as an absolute belief must extend the right of a woman's right to choose the allocation of her bodily resources beyond pregnancy and into every instance of life. Therefore the pro-choice line of reasoning that says that a woman has the right to choose to abort because she does not wish do share her bodily resources can be extended to conclude also that a newborn infant can be aborted if a woman decides not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she has no access to formula (no other factors involved).

2632	0	a	"Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...""Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria."" ""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme""http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.aspTalkorigins gave their usual doubletalk""Whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htmOne poster on another forum summed the problem up like this..."" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantagesBut, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain? If nylon eating bacteria was ""proof"" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source.""http://www.christianforums.com/t52336"

2641	0	a	For those who are pro-life, how much of a role does your belief in a soul (assuming you hold such beliefs) play into your views on abortion? To explore this, would your views on a particular abortion change if you knew for certain that a particular fetus has no soul?The reason I bring this up is that, for those of us with largely secular views, the idea of the soul is closely analogous to our idea of mental existence, sentience, etc. I suspect, therefore, that much of our thinking may end up being similar but that you view this mental essence as starting at conception and we take the scientific view of it happenning much later in a pregnancy. I know that, apart from that arguement, you value potential more than we do. However, I suspect that concepts of the soul do play a role in the views of most on the pro-life side.

They also get put in prison and are proud some of them , gang leaders consider it a mark of honor something some of them getting caught by the 'fuzz' and put in jail. Who are we to decide who is to live? What makes us so much better? Hitler didnt deserve to live but that does not give us the right to kill him.I agree with shooter and proud but hey heres a situation, why don't we give murderers fates to the ones most hurt by their crime, and rapists fates are decided by the ones t hey rape. They would know the best. IF the ones raped are too young such as under maybe 10 or are like seven or its a loved one and they can't seperate justice from love, then the case be decided by law. Give them the chance to live in solitary confinement, give them the chance, we can always take it away. But those killed don't get no more chances. In prison if they do kill put them in confinement. Same with the others, if they are in solitary and they succeed in killing someone else , death penalty then fine. But gang murders should be different, if someone is in jail for killing a gang member in a fight or something like that , it is murder but it isnt as open and as clear justice as it is if they shot a four year old in the head for being related to someone in an opposing gang. Then its wrong flat out, solitary or death penalty. Personally Id be for giving them death penalty for anyone who would do that. But I have two three year old cousins who I love to death and would kill anyone who harmed them so I do not want anyone to get away with killing kids. Child killers are some of the worst criminals there are.

Since it's no longer PC To attack African-Americans for their obvious differences, it's not PC to go after other religions (especially Judaism - not that it actually stops pure hate groups from doing it) they have decided that attacking a group of people which are sexually different should be the way to go.I mean, their religion tells them that premarital sex is bad and wrong. Even though there is a multi-billion dollar industry based around HETEROSEXUAL sex, they actually depend on that money too much to bite the hand that feeds them. Insted, they attack a group that has not legal rights to marriage let alone little legal standing as far as individual rights. It's easier that way.

2712	0	a	The more we seek to redefine marriage, and chip away at God's original design for the home, the more we put our families and our nation at risk.How do you know what God's original design for the home was? How do you know that God didn't create homosexuals for a reason (i.e. helping raise children of people who can't care for them)? How is allowing 2 people who commit to love eachother for life putting heterosexual families and the nation at risk? At risk from what?This debate about gay marriage is really just the latest outgrowth of a culture that for decades has been drifting from biblical standards of truth and morality. The sexual revolution, for example, sought to bring legitimacy to sex outside of marriage. The women's liberation movement worked to revolutionize the roles of men and women in marriage and in our society. Throw in a rising emphasis on materialism and personal happiness, and you end up with a dramatically new way of looking at marriage.When millions of Americans view marriage from the mindset of “What's in it for me?” concepts like responsibility, self-sacrifice, and lifelong commitment become secondary. Is it any wonder that our divorce rate is so high? Or that the number of children born outside of marriage continues to rise? Or that an increasing number of couples are opting to live together instead of marrying?And now the push for gay marriage seeks to redefine marriage even further. From the moment God created marriage, it was designed with a man and woman in mind. God designed two sexes male and female—He did not create four sexes. Homosexual marriage cannot fulfill God's purposes for marriage.I realize we are not all Christians here. However, this issue of gay marriage transends all of society and it will have a negative effect on all of us. JMHO.

I'd suggest reading Thinking Big to get a better idea of the plan, but the basic idea is that employers pay money into a public fund, enough to cover their workers.# The public fund should have quality coverage for all, including preventive care.# Workers get to choose - keep your insurance, choose a different private plan, or join a public health insurance plan without a private insurer middleman, pick your healthcare providers and doctors.# Employers choose too. Those who prefer not to shoulder the burden of providing coverage as good as the law requires can decide to enroll their workers in the public plan at a modest cost.# HCFA and Medicare would function as a single nationwide insurance pool covering close to half the population. So basically either the public plan attracts most Americans, and our system gradually evolves into single-payer or because the floor prevents a race to the bottom, the public-private competition raises the bar on care and efficiency, improving quality and cutting costs, even in the private insurance plans.# The standards would be kept by a strong government watchdog.# What do you think?"

2731	0	a	Your reasoning would be applicable if only one copy of the gene in question ever existed.If the chance of mutation A happening is one in a billion, and the chance of mutation B happening is also one in a billion, then the chance of them both happening together to a single gene is, as you say, beyond the realms of possibility at 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.However, we're not talking about a single gene. A population of a billion bacteria is nothing unusual, and all of them will contain the same gene. So while the odds of any individual experiencing mutation A are very low, the odds of one of them experiencing it are pretty high. The lottery works on the same principle. You probably won't win, but someone probably will.Ok, so now we have our billion bacteria, one of which possesses mutation A. However, the odds of mutation B stacking with it are still only 1 in 1,000,000,000.Now, if mutation A isn't particularly helpful, that's probably the end of the story. But if mutation A is helpful, then that bacterium will outcompete its peers for resources, and breed more readily than they do - either better in absolute terms, or better in immediate proximity, when in competition for the same resources. Either way, the proportion of the population possessing mutation A will increase until they predominate. Now there isn't just one copy of the A-mutant gene in circulation, there are about a billion, and the odds of mutation B stacking with just one of them are greatly improved. Once again, if mutation B is helpful the descendents of that bacterium will flourish and overrun the population, so that in a relatively short time (a few hundred bacterial generations) a single cell possessing neither mutation can give rise to a population of a billion all possessing not one but two billion-to-one mutations - a population ready for the next billion-to-one mutation to occur, and stack, and flourish, and so on.I hope that helps.

2740	0	a	"As theorized, the concept of evolution is analogous to slow morphing, rather than quick abrupt changes in a species. MORPHING!, as can be done with computer graphics programs designed by intelligent beings. Evolution implies species go through a process of advantagous and purposful change -- but morphing is accomplished by unintelligent random processes, or at least that's how the story goes -- the created universe and life were random events. I have been patiently waiting for many years but to date have never seen or heard of any species morphing into another species. I am aware of genetic defects that limit species but unaware of mutations that perpetuate new species. Clearly variation within species is possible and has been observed, such as poodles and great danes, but they remain members of the same species.Mankind has thousands of years of written history and I am unaware of anyone observing species morphation(Is that a word?). Although it is approaching 200 years after Darwin hypothesised how species might have originated, we are no closer to observing a species morphing than Darwin. Humans attempt to create new species, such as breeding donkey with horses to get mules and lions with tigers to get ligers, but these ""NEW"" species are almost always born sterile and unable to perpetuate themselves. Besides observing it, the way to demonstrate evolution is to manipulate a species until it developes into a new species, but alas, then all you will have proven is directed efforts of intelligent beings create species. Hmm, wonder what intelligent being(s) created us?"

2758	0	a	Intellegent Design is the study of the idea that certain biological phenomena are too complex to have been evolved from a series of simpler organisms, and therefore must have been created fully functional from the onset. It is based on the idea that if we can observe an organism or an organic function whose existence cannot be explained by the successive adaptation of the evolutionary model, then that organism or function is evidence for intelligent design. When intelligent design first emerged, among the long list of examples of irreducibly complex phenomena were the eye, the flagellum and blood clotting. All of these have been shown to have simpler counterparts which also fucntion, and therefore which could have been the evolutionary basis for the emergence of these more complex functions. These examples are summarized in wikipedia's article Irreducible complexity - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

2798	0	a	Guidance by humans in the blind Watchmaker does not stop it being a reasonable analogy for his idea that no higher intelligence is in evolution but it can produce . In the analogy the guidance by humans represents natural selection. You could represent the rules of natural selection as set of equations with random elements that contained no human ingenuity instead but I don't see it as a crime to use a human forced to act under restrictions to represent that has nothing to do with humans. I will show youYou could describe electrons as things that hate other electrons but like positive charges. If some electrons see other electrons coming at them down a wire they will also move down the wire to avoid them. If it means going through a circuit an powering a light globe to do the electrons will still flow if the circuit is complete. Now lets think about whats happening, each indivual electron hates large group of electrons coming towards it but to get out of the way it will have to get closer to other electrons (those punks). So if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease. What about a double adaptor? All it does is let the current go through two different circuits. Now if there are two light globes will they both glow half as bright? No. Why because the resistance is halved and there will be twice as much total electron flow. A lot of laws in electric circuit theory made sense to me when I imagined I was an electron going through a wire and how happy I would be going down a wire. Electrons are not happy but I still had an analogy that gave me answers so I was happy. I would have been better off being told that voltage is joules per coloumb so the voltage drop between circuits must be the same.

2813	0	a	The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. Rights Retained by the PeopleAside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those. 1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives. ''It has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.'' 2 It is clear from its text and from Madison's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction, making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated, and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement. 3 Recently, however, the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions.

2850	0	a	SCHUMER: OK. Now, let me ask you this. When you wrote that statement, you did not -- as we discussed yesterday -- when you wrote that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion, you had no exceptions. So that would mean, at least in 1985, your view then, there would be no constitutional protection for a woman to terminate her pregnancy even if the termination was needed to preserve her future ability to have children, right?ALITO: Senator, it was a general statement that didn't go into -- it didn't...SCHUMER: But it had no exceptions. You didn't make that...ALITO: It was one sentence, and it certainly didn't represent...SCHUMER: There was no -- you didn't write any exception for that situation. Correct? It just said the Constitution does not protect. It was without exception. And, yesterday, you didn't argue me when I mentioned that without exception.ALITO: I don't recall your using the words without exception. SCHUMER: I think I did.(CROSSTALK)SCHUMER: If you believe...ALITO: Could I just answer that question? It's one sentence and it certainly is not an attempt to set out a comprehensive view of the subject.SCHUMER: No, I understand that. But it was a very strong statement. It didn't talk about any exceptions at all. And the way I read that statement, even if a woman was raped by her father, she'd have no constitutional protection to have an abortion and terminate that pregnancy. If you believe the Constitution protects no right to an abortion that would follow, wouldn't it?ALITO: I think the statement speaks for itself, and it's one sentence and it's not an effort to set out a comprehensive view of...SCHUMER: Knowing these examples, do you still refuse to distance yourself in any way from a broad, unqualified statement, without exception, that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion? No ands, ifs or buts, is my words.ALITO: What I actually said was that I was proud of my participation in the Thornburg case in which the government made the argument that it made in the Thornburg case...SCHUMER: But you said in the previous sentence to that statement that you personally held those views.ALITO: That's correct. But what I was talking about there was the Thornburg case and nothing more than the Thornburg case.SCHUMER: I understand. But you haven't rethought the position at all, even knowing these extreme cases and the hardship that it might cause?ALITO: Well, what you have pointed out is exactly why, if the issue were to come up, and one were to get beyond stare decisis, the whole judicial decision-making process would have to be gone through.SCHUMER: You didn't think that through in 1985?ALITO: I was not involved in...SCHUMER: When you wrote the statement. When you wrote that statement.ALITO: And when I wrote the statement what I was saying was that I was proud of what I had done in relation to the Thornburg case, which was to write the memo that the committee is aware of, which did not argue that Roe should be overruled, did not argue that the government should argue that Roe should be overruled, but that the decision should be challenged on other grounds that were quite similar.SCHUMER: I understand what you wrote, but you also -- we can bring the statement up here, but I don't want to go over the thing of yesterday. I would just ask you to think of all the consequences of a broad statement, even from 1985, that the Constitution does not protect the right to abortions. Not an exception of health of the mother, not an exception of rape or incest, not an exception of any of these others. I didn't see any of those in your job application. But I want to conclude on...ALITO: Senator...SCHUMER: Go ahead, please.ALITO: It was one sentence. And I think what you're saying highlights the importance of not addressing this until the judicial process takes place where all of this complexity would be taken into account.SCHUMER: In all due respect, sir, I think it highlights the importance of an obligation to discuss it, particularly in light of a strong statement before.But we'll have to differ on that.

Saying that Jesus told you that all life is special doesn't comfort a rape victim, doesn't provide health care to a woman without it, doesn't feed a family if a single mom has to quit her job, doesn't provide an education if she has to quit school. Reducing women to pretty quote that is hung in your kitchen doesn't mean squat out in here in the real world, and it doesn't indicate that you get it, let alone care.
2907	0	a	"For obvious reasons we Christians have always been adamant supporters of civil liberties when it comes to freedom of religion. We have even managed to be consistent in this principle by not opposing the rights of Buddhists, New Agers, or even Satanists to meet, because we realize that to do so would equally undercut our own right to assemble. Perhaps the thought of undermining religious freedom sends through our minds flashes of those days when the Emperor Nero used to ignite Christians as human torches to light the streets of Rome at night. The persecutions against the early church have ingrained into our Christian consciousness the incredible value of living under a government that protects the interests of religion.But in the case of civil same-sex marriage, instead of recognizing the civil rights issue at stake here, we oppose the idea, quoting Bible verses and appealing to morals, nature, tradition, history, and the fear that Western civilization as we know it will come crashing to the ground. All of these arguments are related, of course. They are an appeal to that part of American society in which Judeo-Christian values are still deeply rooted. For even in America at the dawning of the 21st century, many people's understanding of morality and nature still reflect the vestiges of the Western Christendom of our heritage, as do their ideas of tradition, history and an ideal society.We do not, however, argue against civil same-sex marriage in the spirit of calm persuasion. There is desperation in our tone. There is also a great deal of fear and mean-spiritedness in our rhetoric, to the point where we even accuse homosexuals (without much proof, I might add) of being child molesters and sexual predators, and of seeking to corrupt our youth by recruiting them into their ""lifestyle.""There are probably many people who think they are justified in having such fears, but it seems to me it is more than just paranoia that feeds our frenzy. We feel deeply threatened, for we sense that we are losing the battle. Not simply the battle against homosexuals, but the battle to hang on to what we still think of as ""Christian America.""At one time in this country we could count on quoting a verse from Genesis or Leviticus before Congress or the Supreme Court and that would be the end of the debate. No more. The consensus of common biblical values on which we had once depended is giving way to the pluralism of a postmodern society. And seeing the disastrous handwriting on the wall, we have become politically desperate, and so we lunge at the enemies of Christendom with a ferocity that rivals that of even the most radical gay activists."

2922	0	a	"This post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why ToE is a sham along with a challenge to any Darwinist to prove me wrong.ToE is constructed on a fraud premise. This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene. Whenever an evolutionist talks about “evolution” he's not talking about mere phenotypic change – he's talking about changes in genes. To a Darwinist, just because an animal changes phentoypically, or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that “evolution” has occurred. A fish could morph into a human, but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered ""evolution."" The only way evolution can happen, by their own definition, is if there is a change in genetics. This premise, I suggest is a complete and total fraud...and I will explain why now:Let's take humans and dogs, for example. When compared side-by-side, sure enough, humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not – and possibly the other way around. But just because humans may have certain genes that dogs don't, does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs. Of course, there are no “dog genes” or “human genes.” But likewise there are no “tongue genes,” “tail genes” or “toenail genes.” Parts are not translated genes. Thus, the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible.But it's worse than that.As I said before, humans have a whole slew of genes – theoretically, at least -- that dogs (or other animals) don't have. But evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms! That's why they analyze DNA with such scrutiny! But did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are? Scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have...But they've got it backwards! Instead, we have the genes we have because of who we are. A dog isn't a dog because he barks; a dog barks because of what he is. Same with genes.This, of course, spells destructin to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud. Evolution, thus, should not be a theory based on changes in genes, but a theory based on changes in traits.But scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them. They simply won't give up because they've seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses.But here's where they're screwing everything up:When you were a kid did you ever stand on your head? If so, did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time? If so, do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head? Or, do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red? That's excactly what science is doing with genetics: they've got the audacity to claim that changes in genes (the red face) is causing the organsim to change physiologically (go upside down.) In reality, what's happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment (turning upside down) and then the genes are responding in kind (turning red).The only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things:1) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures. 2) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over.So there it is. Go for it."

In a tone I now rather regret, I blurted out two things......How weak was your faith before?and...If the ""evidence"" had gone 'the other way,' would your faith then have been weakened?His answer for the second question was a simple 'no,' which suggests to me that the sense of the term 'evidence' he was employing was not the same sense you'd expect a scientist to use.His response to the first was problematic, and interesting. ""My faith,"" he said, has always been--then he used the most interesting word--""complete."" But he had taken sufficient offence already, it seemed, that I pressed no further. I wish sometimes that I'd asked: If your faith was ""always complete,"" did the archaeological evidence make it ""more complete""? And, if so, does your sense of 'complete' match that word's usual application?I do not quite grasp the notion of there being ""scientific evidence"" for a proposition within the realm of faith. I do not mean to suggest that my claim that scientific and religious propositions reside in different discourses disposes of all worry or complaint. Activity in one realm may be felt in the other.But, re: evolution, I think this...Given convincing evidence that, say, the earth is billions of years old, not thousands--a mound of evidence more than high enough for my needs--my worry is not that the 'Biblical account' of creation is wrong, erroneous, falsified...but rather is the quite different worry of wondering what, now, that account's meaning is, what it affirms. Scientific discovery, evidence, and discourse thus don't ""disprove the Bible."" Rather, they serve to displace interpretations of biblical text, and give us cause--I call it: opportunity--to find new, richer meaning in scripture. I'm often embarrassed by the smallness and brittleness of certain Christians' interpretations. Emphasizing the 'literal,' as some do--a very problematic term in itself--some Christians see in, for example, the Genesis ""tree of the knowledge of good and evil"" nothing more than a tree. A biological tree. Pear tree. Peach tree. Apple tree. Tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Albeit a special species, nonetheless a species. And, for them, there you go--Eve chowed down on the fruit of a proscribed species, and that's your story. Lost, in the insistence upon and closing of that interpretation, is the richness of metaphor the story offers. Metaphor, again and again, is variously deliberately denigrated or unconsciously eclipsed, in the readings of certain Christians.Science is not the only victim of such cheesily 'literal' interpretation. Christian faith--at least, the possibility of a rich faith robustly aware of its own weight in metaphor, parable, legend and myth, and the transformative power that arises from those aspects of scripture--is equally victim. I feel more sadness about such a limited believer's faith than I do about that person's science.Master_Shake, for your poignantly apt remark--""what they have isn't faith at all""--thanks. Bless you!Brad"

Everyone has some basis for the views they have about they way they think society would be best. There's no law that says people can't participate in that process with religion or anything else as their moral basis. 'Imposing religion' is not the same as using religion as a basis, and it's the fact that you are wrong on this that's why religious people are continually able to have religion as their basis of social change, just as equally as anything else.

2996	0	a	On this 35th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, I would like to share my views on the issue of abortion.Life begins at the point of conception. No one can deny that after a human being is conceived it will develop into the very same being as those debating this issue. What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death. Would these very same people agree that a similiar choice should have been made about their own existence? Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions. They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created. What ever happened to taking responsibility for one's actions in this country? Is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption? Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter! Does the father of the child have a say in this? And what about the constitution of the United States? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? I believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed. We need to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and get back to cherishing life in this country. For a country that murders it's children cannot be far from self destruction.

3027	0	a	Read these storys of self defence and then tell me Brady how you can justify theseThe injustice of the British ban on self defenseMaking matters worse, the British legal system seems to treat crime victims worse than it treats the criminals who attacked them. An example is the Tony Martin case:Tony Martin was a farmer, whose remote farmhouse had been broken in to many times. Martin feared future burglary attempts and the risk of being attacked by a violent burglar. When a pair of burglars broke in while he was home, Martin opened fire with a pump action shotgun. The 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras was killed, and 33-year-old Brendon Fearon was wounded in the leg. Later on that day, the police arrested Tony Martin and charged him with the crimes of murder and wounding with intent. At trial, Martin argued that he had acted in self defense, but the court found that he had fired while they were trying to flee. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, although the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence. The surviving criminal, who had over 30 criminal convictions, then sued Tony Martin for the injury he suffered during the burglary. The parole board refused to grant Tony Martin an early release because he “has shown no remorse and would continue to pose a danger to any other burglars.” Martin was eventually released from prison after spending years in prison and being vilified by the anti-gun groups in the UK for shooting criminals who had broken into his home.Another example, from 2009, also shows how the British legal system favors criminals over their victims:A millionaire businessman has been jailed for attacking a man who held his family hostage in their own home – while the criminal went free. Munir Hussain, who was threatened at knifepoint and tied up by a gang of masked men in his living room last year, was told he must go to prison for 30 months to preserve “civilised society”. But Walid Salem, a criminal with more than 50 convictions, was handed a two-year supervision order for his role in the break-in at an earlier hearing. He was one of three men who ambushed Mr Hussain, his wife and children as they returned to their home in High Wycombe, Bucks, on Sept 3 last year after attending Ramadan prayers at their local mosque, Reading Crown Court heard. Their hands were tied behind their backs and they were forced to crawl from room to room before being forced to lie down in the living room. But when Hussain's teenage son managed to escape and raise the alarm, he seized his chance and turned on his captors. . . The brothers were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent by a jury in September. Sentencing, Judge John Reddihough told them it was his “public duty” to jailing Munir Hussain for 30 months and his brother for 39 months.This one is quite nice as wellCleared: Builder who chopped off thug's ear with Samurai sword after he threatened to rape and kill his family | Mail OnlineWell thank god for the gun ban in england.

From WikipediaSome important concepts (and why the word no longer has meaning in biology) is the concept of an intrinsic need to improve. Such concepts were discredited with Darwin. As is pointed out, opponents of evolution use the word in a disparaging way in order to reduce science to religion on a level with ""creationism"". While ""creationism"" is a belief in mythology based on no evidence, no one ""believes"" in evolution. Evolution consists of observations that are explained by the theories of evolution."

Sure, people may still oppose gay marriage even if it's done legislatively as opposed to judicially, but at least then they'd have the chance and opportunity to do so. With only the judicial means, people feel that they have no say whatsoever in something they feel is important. So I think there really is something to this concern than gay marriage is slipped in via judicial fiat. Of course you feel they shouldn't have a say, so you have no problem with the idea of doing by judicial fiat.

3134	0	a	* There is abundant evidence that many of the rock strata were laid down quickly, one after the other, without significant time breaks between them. For example, preservation of ripple marks requires rapid burial, as in the Flood (e.g. lower Triassic rock, England). Folding of sedimentary rock without cracking or heating, such as at Eastern Beach, Auckland, New Zealand, suggests the folding occurred before the sand and mud had time to turn into stone, consistent with rapid deposition during the Flood.

Eileen McDonagh wants us to believe that the child growing inside of a woman is trespassing. One trespasses when he's not in his rightful place, but a baby developing in the womb belongs there.

3148	0	a	I agree, no oath should be taken lightly. However, I believe that a certain amount of interpretation is essential, especially in grey areas that medicine can wander into. Abortion to save the life of the mother is a grey area that doctors have to wrestle with. Separating siamese twins where there is only one heart, allowing one to live while the other dies instead of both dying is a grey area. Following an oath such as that to the letter puts things too much in black and white, when a lot of good medicine happens in the shades of grey.

3159	0	a	A few blocks from my house there is a group of stores with some offices on the second floors. Apparently there is a Planned Parenthood office in the complex because a group of anti-abortion protestors were there the other day. I didn't know that before then. I wondered what they hoped to accomplish by their protest so I asked them. One woman said she hoped to discourage women from considering abortion. I didn't think of it at the time, but Planned Parenthood does a lot more than abortion services. I wonder if the protests might also dissuade a young woman who was seeking contraceptive services from going into that office as well. If this were the case, the abortion protests would accomplish the opposite of their goal. They potentially could have increased the chances of an unwanted pregnancy by discouraging contraceptive use. In turn, this might increase the chances of an abortion. I wonder if anti-abortion folks ever consider that?

3181	0	a	The record already acquired is amazingly good. It provides us with many detailed examples of a great variety of evolutionary phenomena on lower and intermediate levels and rather abundant data that can be used either by controlled extrapolation or on a statistical sampling basis for inferences as to phenomena on all levels up to the highest. Among the examples are many in which, beyond the slightest doubt, a species or a genus has been gradually transformed into another. Such gradual transformation is also fairly well exemplified for subfamilies and occasionally for families, as the groups are commonly ranked.... In spite of these examples, it remains true, as every paleontologist knows, that most new species, genera, and families appear in the record suddenly and are not led up to by known, gradual, completely continuous transitional sequences.George Gaylord Simpson, The Major Features of Evolution (New York: Columbia University Press, 1961), pp 359-60.

3228	0	a	I personally am astounded at the overreaction of the government in response to a handfull of shootings in NO. Sending in the army in full force, confiscating guns and talking about an 'insurgency' just because of a couple of crackpots have been firing their guns.On an average day in New York there are 10 times as many reports of shootings, yet I don't see such a massive military response over there...

If we were able to prove that our dating procedures were false and that really we stood on 2 legs back when the Earth was created and that the fossil record is not really as we thought it was, evolution would be falsified. Intelligent design can simply not be falsified because there is no supporting evidence for it. That is the line between religion and science.

3234	0	a	Fundamental RightsThis relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.
3235	0	a	let me try to translate into words1. if there is a god in this world, there is a god in all worlds2. there being a god is a possibility3. If there's a god in all worlds, there's a god in this one4. There not being a god in all worlds implies that there's isn't a god in any world (all or nothing)5. There is either a god in all worlds or there isn't a god in all worlds6. from 4,5 there either is a god in all worlds or no god in any world7. if there's no god in this world then there's not a god in all worlds8. There's either a god in all worlds or there is no god in any world.9. Since god is a possibility we know the statement <there is no god in any world> is false.10. Since there's a god in all worlds there's a god in this one from 3Is this the right interpretation? If it is there is one flaw in it. #9 is flawed. Just because there's a possibility of a god doesn't mean that there is a god in some world, just that there's a possibility of him being in some world.

Personally, I think U.S. conservatives have gotten too complacent these days--we need to protest like this more often. We've gotten to where we lay down too easily and let ourselves get run over too easily by immoralism. These people in Spain are showing great courage--U.S. conservatives could learn a lot from them.

3244	0	a	"Your analysis might be correct, although I don't think I'd bet big money on it. In particular, I'm not sure about your conclusion here:""The legislature is required to consider constitutional amendments in a joint session until final action is taken.""My reading is simply that if they don't reach a conclustion in one session, they have to take it up again in the next one. If it's going to pass, it has to pass in two consecutive years, so simply taking it up in year three and saying, ""Didn't pass in two consecutive years, failed"" may be legit."

It would be more sensible to evaluate a person's life at, age 10 perhaps, and then kill them if they have been unhappy and are likey to continue. Again, anyone on welfare is a likely target. In fact, it might be expedient to simply nuke the poorest parts of the world.

Instead, I see such a stigma for single mothers, I see single mothers unable to finish school, I see single mothers unable to work a decent job b/c of either lack of education or lack of child care, I see systems where the men don't have to support, violence, et cetera.

3263	1	a	let's just cut to the chase on your spurious claim. when was the xivth amendment passed.? here is the enforcement provisions of the act of 1964: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_rights_act_of_1964 heller ruled that the 2a was about more than 'discrimination on gun laws' in that as long as the 'discrimination was equal it would be legal according to the plaintiffs and muncipalities'. that was ruled out and dismissed by scotus. you are building a strawman trying to imply i said your words. you are a poor liar. ad absurdum!

3268	1	a	do you think your evading the questions that get to the root of your denials is actually helpful to your side of the debate?  why are you trying so hard to deny the fact that conception originates a new organism? that conception is the beginning of that new organism's life and physical existence? that conception is in that respect, the birth of a new organism?  why does that fact bother you so much?

3279	1	a	currently, in the u.s., when you buy a gun, you don't get it right away. it has to be registered and if you pass a sanity check, they'll approve it. it is because of this registration process that illegal guns are brought into the country and sold..., illegally. if you ban guns, this black market will flourish and the number of unregistered guns will increase. the crazies that want to shoot up a bunch of people will still be able to get a gun. i prefer regulation over making things illegal and banning them. i also prefer freedom over safety. but hey..., that's just me..., well..., me and a bunch of crazed, gun packing, red blooded americans ;)

3293	1	a	but they single out polygamists. this is a very disingenuous rebuttal of yours to steeeeve's point. it's like saying that we should just leave sodomy laws in place or state marriage amendments because the laws apply equally no matter what the race or creed of the gay people involved. obviously you're either completely missing steeeeve's point in using polygamists to analogize the issues here or intentionally avoiding it.
3294	1	a	wow. talk about mental problems in a can... not the issue. you claimed my signature isn't valid and proves nothing. therefore you must disagree with it. therefore if you disagree with it, you consider that christanity is the sole religion on the planet.  irrelevant.  you disagree with my signature. therefore you believe that every other religion except christanity is not a religion.  i suspect you don't actually believe this and you're just trying to cover up for your giant cockup. if you actually believed that christanity was the sole religion on the planet, you'd have no problem walking into a mosque or a synagogue or a temple and saying to all those believers that their religions don't exist.

3332	1	a	i think yes! very important to show that any violence will be punished. it will create full sense of the force of law. on the other hand people will understand that they must take care about animals. and it may be impetus that will make less stray animals.
3333	1	a	after reading what you wrote 0 people were convinced that the original quote wasn't funny.
3334	1	a	there have certainly been many times since life appeared on earth that the 'habitability' of the planet has been less than now. i would differentiate between 'natural' events and man's efforts.
3335	1	a	well its not...aren't you more concerned about those people that have a abortions after unprotected sex? no i'm not. to me it doesn't matter how the fetus got there, and seriously, why is it relevant for you to know that? what result? describe to me the result and we'll see if its the same. well. with condoms.. you have no baby. and with abortion, you don't have any baby either..
3336	1	a	no, i don't watch fox news because i don't have those channels.
3337	1	a	when i don't address it.  every false religion is a cult and therefore your's is a cult.
3338	1	a	is the bible fiction or a historical text with accurate accounts of the time periods being written about? hahahahahahahahahahhahahahaahahahahahahahahah
3339	1	a	most of his links were in reference to another question. that's partially my doing as i introduced the kerry attack in the wrong thread. i don't like to hijack threads. i'm just addicted to hating kerry because he was pro-communist in the early '70s. maybe he can be appointed ambassador to north vietnam after he loses this election! you dislike my techniques because i point out your propensity to confuse and digress when you try to argue. you come up with more unrelated **** than anyone else on this board. your sense of logic is blinded by your delusions of adequacy. i put little credence in anything you say.
3340	1	a	nice work; i think that the reason those kids who own guns are more likely to get into trouble is a result of a specific political outlook that they are raised under which has an influence on their thinking.
3341	1	a	'what is missing from public consciousness is that the rulings of the courts starting with parker in 2007 are devastating defeats for the gun rights core doctrine that the purpose of those gun in private hands, outside of the knowledge and reach of a governing authority, is to maintain an anarchic balance of power between a privately armed populace and any and all government. the political leadership to carry those rulings forward does not exist.' second amendment, gun control, the potowmack institute i'm a bit confused. it seems like the supreme court has taken a much more moderate position on the issue than people like you typically advocate. perhaps you could clarify. what gun laws do you support?
3342	1	a	evolution is taken as a scientific theory taken as fact based upon a preponderance of factual evidence.  creationism is a theory that is taken as fact without any actual factual basis. also, nice ethnocentrism buddy.
3343	1	a	you may not believe it but morals wise this country is going to hell in a handbasket, and if the 'big guy in the sky' is looking down at things that are happening here he can not be happy...... judgment day might be on us sooner then we think..... you can scoff at that though......that is the same thing they did before the big flood and the destruction od sodom...........
3344	1	a	i am leaving the job to those more qualified. i'm weighing the yes-votes against the no-votes, and the yes-votes are strongly winning. this is what the word consensus means. qualified global warming skeptics still seem to me to be a small minority. 650 are mentioned in this report. but when i think of all the climate scientists in the world, there must be tens or hundreds of thousands on the other side of the debate.
3345	1	a	not that i have the time to research this (it's fairly obvious anyway) the blue states tend to send the sleaziest bastards to washington. that's a fact. you can count the red scum and the blue scum. you'll find the blue scum returned to washington by their constituency while the red scum is continually kicked out of office. i'd rather be a dead republican than a democrat.
3346	1	a	not forever. we just don't know when he'll return. when christ comes down on earth (the rapture), it is said that all the believers will rise into heaven and he'll close the sky again. the remaining people on earth will have seven years of abundance, then seven years of absolute torture; there will be no peace at all on earth.
3347	1	a	if it is bs as you say, then you should be able to easily provide rebuttals to each and every acronym, no? saying something is bs without actually showing counterarguments is in itself 'bs.'
3348	1	a	the king james version, as richard dawkins says, is the origin of hundreds of phrases and language part of our common lexicon, and to read it is to help educate yourself on some english literature. also, you can't argue against religious people unless you know what their perspective is, hence reading their books. i wish they'd return the favour. oh and, it's so much fun reading all the fucked up shit they think is morally perfect, i mean, in genesis, you have lot's daughters incestually raping him in a cave, then in exodus you've got god murdering thousands of babies, it's brilliant. oh, and the books of law are hilarious, where else can you find a moral guide that condones slavery and even gives you instructions on how to beat your slaves.
3349	1	a	care to explain where this fiction came from? i didn't think so.
3350	1	a	who is this 'us' you speak of? you got a pet in your pocket? your buddy gaonosa who assured us you weren't a bb has abandoned you it appears. perhaps he saw you as the lost cause you appear to be? when the whole world appears to be nuts, look in the mirror and you will find him emoticonxagree
3351	1	a	well this is nice to come back to- jc making serious debate. on top of that, one i agree with xd
3352	1	a	no, god loves me so much that he sent his son to earth to pay the penalty for my sins. past, present and future. i have eternal life now, based on the promises in god's word. i also know that, like a loving father, god disciplines me to get me back on track and in line with his will. i'ts true that god loves you, but god cannot accept you the way you are now. if and when you discover who god really is, then you will understand that god changes people from within. god wants you to come to him, but on his terms, not yours.
3353	1	a	given the following:  -there is no evidence for the existence of god. -there is no evidence against the existence of god. due to the fact that there are an infinite number of false premises, and only a limited number of true premises, it is better to err on the side of skepticism. this is why the burden of proof rests on the believers. until such time this burden of proof is satisfied, the logical position is the position of skepticism. i cannot say with absolute certainty that god does not exist, but i will live my life as if that were the case until proven otherwise.
3354	1	a	okemoticonxrolleyes people who make the law,people who influence the people who make the law,people who interpret the law. they set the perameters to your freedom and rights. your 'rights' and' freedoms' are what they want them to be not necessarily what you want them to be..therefore they are not necessarily rights or freedoms are they? i am ok with that to a point but in the uk at least i think they are unfair to some . i never said they should be unlimited. is that ok or do you need a stick drawing?emoticonxclown
3355	1	a	don't get me wrong, i am not in the least bit worried, i am an atheist through and through. this just came up in conversation with a religious friend of mine. he said 'don't you think you should believe, just in case' and i answered ' why? god isn't real and if he was he would send me to heaven before you' (the last bit was just to piss him off more than anything.
3356	1	a	are you one of those cuckoo-brains who believes that barack obama is the anti-christ?
3357	1	a	'so they don't really kill babies, they just put them in to a long sleep? is that what you mean?' no. 'and what does 'babies' mean? are you saying that unborn babies aren't really people?' yes, that's exactly what i am saying, and the science is behind my argument, not yours my friend. your personal, religious beliefs on the subject mean absolutely nothing to me. an unviable fetus is not a 'baby'.
3358	1	a	i say yes so that feminists and other women who think they're equal to men can see that they're actually not. i would also like to see them play football, tennis, athletics etc. against each other. then they will really shut the f*ck up.
3359	1	a	you prefer me i am your target since the beginning. when i took a break from cd and came back you are so happy that you message me like 5 times begging for me to let you be my ally i still have them but i am not going to copy and paste them here because you will cry like you did with hellno. cheap words from a false witness that doesn't know knowing but satanic claims.
3360	1	a	they need support from someone else before wwwiii is started. someone like us perhaps..
3361	1	a	have you even read the other arguments? or even researched the topic? i don't care if you're a christian, that's cool and your belief, but give credit where credit is due. christians made the holiday a christian holiday mostly as a way to convert more people. but it's not really a christian holiday, nor do i understand how buying materialistic items or receiving them is very christian...
3362	1	a	why do liberals always resort to personal attacks? why are they so angry? oh wait i know why.......republicans control the presidency, both houses of congress, and most governorships..... i guess i would be angry to if my party was so far down the food chain...... :)
3363	1	a	the question is why did you change the sentence? as has been said, the thermonuclear reaction taking place in the core of the sun is not mentioned in the theory of evolution. so, you managed to make the first sentence of your 'proof' complete and utter rubbish. not a good start then. some other questions i would like answered about your 'proof' would be: why is it assumed that the nuclear reaction taking place in the sun's core would be perfectly linear? from above, if the sun's life is around 10 billion years, why would 4.6 billion years be its half-life? do you know what a half-life is with regards to nuclear reactions? that's just the first paragraph. if you can answer them satisfactorily then i might get onto the rest of your 'proof'. smiley
3364	1	a	Well said Jito. I don't understand why pro-lifers dismiss pregnancy as easy and/or suggest that it's a wonderful snuggly thing that's just the best thing in the world. Even if you want a baby, it's unbelievably hard to go through and something your body never fully recovers from. If you don't want a baby and are being forced to go through it, it's unbearable. You can't force somebody to go through this life-threatening condition that is always physically harmful.
3365	1	a	they accept donations, however. if these donations exceed the cost of hosting a website (pretty inexpensive), where does the money go?  'legitimate rapture notification service' seems like a contradiction in terms. as pt barnum (apocryphally) said...
3366	1	a	the benefits aspect can be resolved simply by petitioning the government to stop using the word marriage and substitute in its place the word civil union and allow any couple (of age of consent) to join in a civil union. right . . . but rather than removing every reference to marriage from every state and federal law and replacing it with the words 'civil union' and then extending the right to participate in a civil union to gay people and straight people alike, wouldn't it be way easier just to, uh, let gay people get married? besides, if the idea of gay marriage is seen as an 'attack' on straight marriage, how exactly is the notion of removing 'marriage' altogether going to be construed? not as a friendly compromise, i'm betting.
3367	1	a	wow, you actually butchered this brain teaser stripping it of all of it's purpose. congratulations.
3368	1	a	sort of like saying you are born conservative, it's not a life style choice?
3369	1	a	a little lesson in biology told me that when the sperm meets the egg, it makes a zygote... that means that fertilization has occured... which means a life has begun (even the medical field and our government agree with this). thats an embryo... a human being... a sperm cannot in and of itself become a human being unless it meets the egg.
3370	1	a	wait until the end, because soon i'll be with god.
3371	1	a	its not the governments job to censor information.  for kids being subjected to things on the internet shouldnt be the governments right to have them see certain things and not see others. thats what parents are for.
3372	1	a	i would like to add, i don't necessarily agree with the health care reform that obama passed, but i will applaud the fact that he actually passed something concerning health care. all the previous presidents since reagan have promised health care and never delivered. they ran on health care, and once elected did nothing . at least obama kept his promise to address the subject. maybe it could have been a better plan, but what we have now is better than the nothing we've had under mostly republicans.. clinton being the only democrat who also failed to deliver ....
3373	1	a	is that like a dude + a pony? that's alright... i'm a bronasaur. dude + a dinosaur.
3374	1	a	shut up heretic. god can do anything.  don't make him smite you. you'll burn in hell for your blasphemy! emoticonxgood emoticonxhoho
3375	1	a	idk what that has to do with this not being a real debate site or peoples emotional reactions. people are going to react accordingly.
3376	1	a	call it what ever floats your boat, but if the majority of americans don;'t want gay marriages, it ain't going to happen. the state has a right to set moral standards for the community. from my personal perspective, that would be an accurate statement, but as i said before i am one person with one vote. if nobody else shared my beliefs, we'd have gay marriage. but the majority of people in states with gay marriage initiatives, including my own state, don't want them, so it would be disengenuous of you to blame me for your pr problems. :)
3377	1	a	why would i want to watch lesser basketball? the skill level of the wnba is nothing special and even a mens minor league team could beat them and since i don't watch minor league teams play i don't watch womens sports.  i make an exception for mud wrestling.
3378	1	a	'umm... what the fuck are you talking about again?' 'reincarnation? walking on water? no different than hitler?'-perhaps i should of compared him to 'jones' instead. just mocking your own skewered belief , thats all. pity you have not figured me out beyond your own bias dysfunctions , then you would hear the tone in my voice for what it is when i type it. ok ..........................your turn...............
3379	1	a	yeah - jason - you should be ashamed of yourself for being such an outright liar. you have an incredibly sordid reputation around here and it just gets worse every time you embarrass yourself like this.
3380	1	a	you can choose to have faith i whatever you want. some feel the bible represents the historical accounts of jesus. it could be mythical, magical or whatever. but, there are many who feel this is real and was produced to represent fact not fiction. you can choose to believe it or not. i don't think that the harry potter series was ever considered anything but fiction. and, i said i interpret it as i desire...not.others. yes, practices at the time condoned many of the things you state, but the bible was about jesus with many of the practices of the time added as historical color not relevant to the actual text itself.
3381	1	a	religious zealots don't believe evolution or biology have anything to do with humans. that's because we are supposedly one step below the angels, a special creation by a very special god. everyone except those wicked, godless gays, naturally.
3382	1	a	for those of you wondering why we have no patience for creationists: http://infoharp.com/2008/05/10/why-e...ht-in-schools/ this is your answer.
3383	1	a	mary magdalene was a woman from whom jesus cast out seven demons (luke 8:2). what kind of a life do you suppose a woman with seven demons lived? she may or may not have been a prostitute but running around with seven demons certainly doesn't bode well for clean living (beforehand).
3384	1	a	actually, they were mostly hung by their puritan accusers. one was even crushed to death with stones prior to being convicted.
3385	1	a	how is changing clothes not like changing genders? we are control of our own lives and if we want to change ourselves we have all right to do so.
3386	1	a	well, i guess the point is...if one is right, you have to have a basis for determining which to follow instead of going at a whim. if you choose to honor some stuff of the bible and not some other stuff in it than you pretty much ruled out that religion, have you not? if you haven't than what basis to you have for changing the rules? the preists surely aren't 'god in disguise' now are they?
3387	1	a	you are an agnostic. you believe in heaven? if you believe in heaven, would you not think that the being who created heaven would have planned for the number of people who will be there? don't you think that the being would have made in large enough for all the people that will be there?
3388	1	a	it is within a mans power to control his emotions this in essence is rationality.
3389	1	a	os, your willful ignorance of actual american history is quite astounding.
3390	1	a	aren't you all up in arms :p if you don't want to answer the question (say because you think it's sarcastic rhetoric) don't answer it, the fact that you responded without apparently any intention of answering or discussion tells me this is just another one of those times where you're mad but helpless. let me guess, you are going to come back with some brilliant attack on my character, save yourself the trouble; i don't want to talk about my character you can have the last word if you want but if you post in response to this i will consider it connected to the string in which my question was asked and i will simply ask you to answer it again.
3391	1	a	if you were the real evelyn waugh who converted to catholicism you would know the answer to your question by now emoticonxrolleyes
3392	1	a	it is kind of funny how abortion has to do with a woman's body. and yet, if it was left up to the state: congress: women hold 81, or 15.1%, of the 535 seats in the 109th us congress  14, or 14.0%, of the 100 seats in the senate and 67, or 15.4%, of the 435 seats in the house of representatives. in addition, three women serve as delegates to the house from guam, the virgin islands and washington, dc. only 15.1%... so that means that 276 men (51 senate/ 225 congress) will be needed just to pass a law that has to do with a women's body...and if its something that could be bad for a woman and/or unfairly good for a man then they can get no where near the amount of senators/representatives needed to supress it.... [66.6666-15.1 = 51.56666--(535/100)(51.56666)=276]  (http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/of...rs/cawpfs.html)
3393	1	a	i'm never without friends, thank you. though there be 450 prophets of baal opposing me, the lord is with me (learn that lesson from the scriptures, sport), and you will never win that fight, or any other.
3394	1	a	this is more about efficiency than effective because of the coercive monopoly. ups and fedex would hire more people where they would be able to cover the vast plains of the united states. the private companies would have more opportunity if the ban on private companies would be repealed.
3395	1	a	i'd no sooner cave in the skull of an infant than a dog. 50characters
3396	1	a	i do not think all guns should be banned, but certainly some. if your a hunter and you want to kill a deer, then go and by a rifle, but do you really need an ak-47 to kill a little deer? and if your buying a gun for protection, then that is just stupid. there are plenty of things you can do before resorting to a gun for protection. get a guard dog, buy an alarm, or move near a place with a lower crime rate. you could also buy a taser or pepper spray.
3397	1	a	something is only dumb to those that cannot comprehend. is a student dumb or the teacher too dumb to teach? one does not train a dog to sit, lay down, crawl, etc, the dog already knows how to do these things. what you do train a dog to do, respond to a command. in order for this to happen one must be smarter than the dog or at least of equal intelligence.  senseless you say. numbers don't matter. how about size? ask your partner.  what purpose does your life have? what is that thing that drives you? mine is to share what i have learned. no one share this with, no reason to move forward. a painter with no brush. passion lost and all else with it.
3398	1	a	yes, i'm sure that's true as well. makes complete sense. but the article is saying that among those with unintended pregnancies, those who are using, are more likely to have an abortion than those who are not using. to me that makes sense as well, but i just wanted to clear up what it was saying.
3399	1	a	that was complete non-response. you totallly made up that there was some 'other speech' pushing a 'socialist agenda.' that's what the sarcasm was about which was evidently lost on you. show me this fabled 'lost speech' baron.
3400	1	a	atheists believe in god.... they just don't want to believe in god because they are in rebellion to god. a parallel is that of a parent and child. when the child does something bad and the parent comes to punish him or her, he or she refuses to accept that he or she has done wrong or that he or she deserves punishment and he or she then rebells to the point of extreme anger. atheists are just angry at god for no real reason.
3401	1	a	i watched a review of the film last night, the reviewer questioned moore on the rosy picture he paints of the nhs and basically moore said that even though nhs isn't perfect it is better than the us system. i will see this film, usually his films are well made no matter what you think of his political views. i do not know much about the us system, say you broke your leg and had to go in for an operation. would you need to pay for that operation?
3402	1	a	No. You can take it as the fact that we do not have proof.The UN has also said that Zionism = Racism. Does everyone accept that?
3403	1	a	'and why should you, anyway?' -reproduction  - if the person is religious (i do not believe god will send gay believers to hell, not sure about atheists)  - if he wants to.
3404	1	a	hey - you're the one who condones sinful, illicit gay-sex sodomy, which god himself calls a perversion, so you're the one who is spiritually and historically challenged. you're right in step with satan, though, so you can really feel proud of that. lol! romans 1:26-27
3405	1	a	it should just be 'stick butter,' that's more descriptive of the actual function. and the mold for the butter should be the shape of a penis. however, i don't know if i want my lube to be the consistency of butter. i like the fact that lube is just watery because its easy to wash off. butter takes more time and scrubbing action to get off... and if it's a wild night you might spend a while in the shower. how would you achieve a substance malleable enough to be formed into a stick, yet easy to wash off? and edible, so no silicone or anything. lube also washes out of fabric pretty easily, and this might not. panties are expensive...
3406	1	a	happy birthday ron!!!!!!!!!! and you have been raising children all your life... duh 8 kids????? do you even remember what it was like to have a quiet moment in your home? and just remember i am big enough to go along with the lucy joke... i even bought a lucy purse this weekend.. i just let it ride.... never let them know how smart you really are :) on edit so many people on right now, there must be more with children... or you and i are just having this conversation by ourselves :)
3407	1	a	nah, it isn't worth the effort if you can't make the connection. g'night my friend.
3408	1	a	i probably wasted time creating this debate. everyone knows blacks commit more crime than other races. who in their right mind is going to argue with that? oh wait, aveskde would argue with a sign post if it was crucial to holding his fantastical world-view together, maybe he'll bite. :)
3409	1	a	10 - 4. roger that. we lost thousands of two way radios. mission accomplished.
3410	1	a	leviticus 18:22 do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable. leviticus 20:13 if a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. they are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. i also grabbed my bible to see what its says in context and it says nothing about temple prostitution or idolatry
3411	1	a	i am using the same definition. however, i do not place confidence in scientists.
3412	1	a	i've hardly ever heard any christian try to convince anyone they are all consistent and harmonized. and i've been around a lot of christians. maybe you'd actually get more christians to consider your points if you'd stop flinging accusations of scams and rudely calling things that are dear to them 'fairy tales'. but hey, it's your loss.
3413	1	a	it's not sexual assault if she's not mentally incapacitated i think. if she brushes her teeth and does other things to suggest she's drunk rather than fully mentally incapacitated and then has sex, why is it sexual assault? -wez
3414	1	a	what's the scoop here? it seems to me with all the shootings that occur in the united states because of all the gun happy nuts running around, everyone would know how to do first aid at the site of a shooting. i understand bullet wounds are kind of nasty because they're deep. there's also the massive loss of blood; to be sure, the massive bleeding would wash out nasty debris but a body can't stand to lose a bunch of blood.
3415	1	a	hurts to be exposed as a pathetic liar doesn't it? har, har, har like father like son. like mother like son. pathetic! craven! disgusting!
3416	1	a	loool justin bieber?! oh that is a sad thing to believe :p dear boy (obviously) whitney houston beats michael jackosn demi lovato beats justin bieber karen carpenter beats every singer on earth<3 opera is the most powerfull woman on earth, obama is said to be the most powerfull man on earth, but i seriously think that opera wins this one too. she's a rolemodel, idol, inspiring woman. love her <3
3417	1	a	One of the wealthiest segments of our population are gays. Now...where's that crying towel and violin. emoticonXCool
3418	1	a	be careful lesz, your hatred for me and your bigotry towards the bible and christianity is showing again. emoticonxwow after all, i didn't write the verses that condemn homosexuality, i just posted them.
3419	1	a	well, i can't argue with you there--i agree 100%. i don't completely agree that benefits to couples should be eradicated altogether (whether marriage or civil unions) but that's your opinion and you are entitled to it.
3420	1	a	you don't think we are part of the food chain? may i remind you that in the last few weeks, australia has been preparing the ground to allow crocodile hunting again because the crocodiles, having no predators to fear, have grown in high numbers and have become a danger to all other animals and humans alike.
3421	1	a	the admin wisely deleted the link. it was a foolish thing to do. not only that, you don't know how that might come back on the owner of this forum. let's say something did happen and they find out it was because of this forum. next thing you know a free forum owner has a lawsuit on his hands. probably not gonna win it but you still have to deal with that.  rule number 1: 1. do not give your name or any personal information that could be used to identify you. do not request personal information, including age. you're not five, act like it.
3422	1	a	satan encourages violence, death, conflict, etc. he doesn't care about what's right and not right. he has no remorse for his actions. sure, you don't have to worship him, but i don't think he encourages people to grow and live their life the 'moral' way.
3423	1	a	he may fear you. you are highly respected on this site. so if you were to make a valid point everybody would support it leaving him at a disadvantage. or maybe he thinks you may be an 'abusive participant(which would make no sense)'. i think he may be afraid.
3424	1	a	yeah, i've been absent more often than not lately thanks to life. but i will tell you i'm pretty awesome. ;)
3425	1	a	the kind aussies are banning. that right there. you're the 'legend in your own mind' type. self-fluffer. ho hum.  that's a span of about 40 years. my point is that graphic depictions of rape are rare in film. clearly you don't understand the formula for slasher films.
3426	1	a	from what i have seen of your prior posts you wouldn't know a value if it slapped you. are you still beating your live in?
3427	1	a	nope, nothing wrong with fox news.  they haven't gotten things wrong('lied') more than any other news station.  while i will admit that most of the people on fox news lean towards the right, they give both sides of the isle a chance to talk.  even if it was a bunch of right wing agenda(it's not) it would only balance things out a little. i mean, look at some of the other news stations.
3428	1	a	but then the bush people never saw a lie that they couldn't embrace.
3429	1	a	can we stick to the issues ink? stupid personal attacks waste time and distract from what's really important. now then, to rebut your smears... 'while wright is a controversial pastor and a fiery advocate for blacks and liberal causes and a fierce critic of anti-black discrimination, we've seen no evidence that he preaches hatred of or discrimination against whites.' http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/                                      sliming_obama.html  'the mccain campaign is distorting the obama-ayers relationship, and exaggerating their closeness. there is no evidence that obama has 'lied' about his dealings with ayers.' http://voices.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/10/did_obama_lie_about_ayers.html  as for acorn... yeah, these guys look like real sons of bitches... everyone knows trying to help the poor makes you a radical commie.
3430	1	a	this is actually simply a place for intelligence to prevail, and for unsupported ideas to be hacked down like hogs hung from a meat hook. if christianity is a worthy religion, it will stand the test of extreme scrutiny. history will support it and the text inside the bible will always speak the truth about society, and how god wants us to live (assuming there is a god, that he directed the writing of the bible, and that he put in the bible what he wanted his creations to do/how to live their lives).
3431	1	a	what party politics? calling people who want to hold bp accountable 'socialists.' mistakes were made, get over it. i've already pointed out the idiocy of attacking bp with a funny cartoon. you attack bp by focusing on its mistakes so that it can be held accountable by trial. if you just ignore those mistakes, it gets off scott free.
3432	1	a	i find that marc's notion funny that the us gov is shoving atheism down the country's throat, when the president is a self confessed christian and the party in power in both house's is the party that bible belt vote for. if the us government is trying to shove atheism down the nations throat then all those self confessed christians on capital hill must be charlatans.
3433	1	a	must have clicked dispute out of habit of disputing idiots. after looking at your posts, i'm not sure intelligence is gonna be your best argument... although, once the window came up i at least had the wherewithal to make sure my position was correct - ie - support = pencil and tag = pencil rather than say i support pencil in one and pen in the other...
3434	1	a	doesn't really change the fact that you were either entirely ignorant of casualties figures, or flat out lied. we got attacked because of our involvement in iraq by the way. those attacks wouldnt have occurred has it not been for the iraq war. that said terrorism isn't new at all here. the ira have been failing at it for decades, some crazy extremists aren't going to do much better. -wez
3435	1	a	xd i don't know if that's insulting to him or a compliment. i just find it amusing. the place i work at is only half fun i guess, tops off only. and you'd be surprised how many girls have fallen off stage trying to get a top off >_< the new ones usually. who didn't know they needed certain shirts that come of easy...
3436	1	a	hyea- right - in england the speaker of the house isn't even allowed to speak... :p ... so-o-o? emoticonxrolleyes

3438	1	a	so let me understand this from you libs..........you can support the troops but hope their mission fails? emoticonxconfused and if course if their mission fails it means more deaths and caualties........hmmmmmmm emoticonxconfused
3439	1	a	no.. go read the bible before you look dumber than you already do. it sounds like you're talking about something you know little about. god didn't want us to be puppets. he wanted us to have free will, to do what we wanted - and if they didn't want to love him, it should be their choice. if sin wasn't created, we would have been god's puppets.
3440	1	a	who's crying? not i. i'm just putting people on notice. your animations are indicative of your inability to come up with a clear concise argument. you resort to false mimicry.  nothing in this thread points to a general dislike of change on my part. it's not my country. it is a country founded by godly men with a clear recognition of our creator and lord. read this and any other posts of mine and you will not find where i give a rat's xxx whether you love god. that is your business. i don't where anyone has characterized the atheists as mean and nasty. i don't recall complaining of being picked on. i simply put out a statement.. not nearly as pitiful as your attempt to make some profound statement.
3441	1	a	wow, that is so original. i know most of us christians have never heard a retort like that. bravo!
3442	1	a	no. disagree with this and i'm going to beat the crap out of you.
3443	1	a	you are completely wrong and delusional. absolute power corrupts absolutely.
3444	1	a	welcome back honey... it's been a while. now prodigee and i may not get along very well but i do think he's right about this. there is no way the good doctor has that many phds. you're all probably the same person but who the hell really cares? i think the doc is kinda funny.
3445	1	a	quite right. the former nytimers and cnners are all familiar with this particular poster's distractions, fallacies, sockpuppets and 'i'm really pro-gay' shtick. he's been doing it for almost a decade now, and none of us are fooled. i hoped a direct challenge would show that--one riposte to aa aside (an attempt at camouflage, no doubt)--the leopard doesn't change his spots. mission accomplished.
3446	1	a	you don't seem to want a written constitution either, or at least one that isn't as vauge as ours. i have gathered from your posts that you want a direct democracy, where everyone gets to vote on each others rights. you want the people to be able vote on such issues as abortion, and marriage, you want a tryanny of the majority. any one who wants people to be able to vote upon the civil rights of another is an enemy of freedom.
3447	1	a	he couldn't be expected to know that, since the american method of teaching geography is war, and they haven't invaded them yet. emoticonxkill
3448	1	a	clearly is not necessarily correctly! even though his statement is convoluted, your calculation based on it, is correct. however, it is more easily understood as: (pop a)x.06=(pop b)x.44 (pop b)/(pop a)=.06/.44=.1364=13.64% one should remember, too, that (pop b) is still part of (pop a). however, i think the claim is more than slightly exaggerated. the prison population can't have increased that much since 2003, when it was 482 per 100,000, or about 0.4%. the nearly 14% number is obviously too high. the prison population was roughly 1.47 million in 2004. with a population of roughly 295,000,000, this means 1.47/295=0.5% of the population is in prison. a far cry from 13.64% http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/popclock http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/...n-prison_x.htm ...and this site says 645 out of 100,000 or 645/100,000=0.0065=0.65% ..still miles from 13.64%

3451	1	a	sex is over rated. people should only have sex in order to reproduce. ;)
3452	1	a	when we demean the holocaust, and the symbols supporting it, we begin to erase those lessons. so you are saying we should try and forget about it? learning about the holocaust is great, and as horrible as it sounds it is probably for the better that it happened. why do i say this? well if it hadn't happened then it would have happened eventually (almost everyone hated jews, blacks and homosexuals at the time), and it happening taught us a valuable lesson. it's horrible to look at it like that; but it is quite true, whether you think so or not. we need things like this to happen in order to grow and develop and mature as a species.
3453	1	a	It has been explained here several times that the statistics indicate that gun ownership makes you more likely to be injured or killed. Perhaps the false sense of power increases risky behaviour in the owner, believing themselves invincible.
3454	1	a	the liberals in this country love to spend money as long as it not theirs........
3455	1	a	any mass of such nature, being extremely hot, will retain the heat for some period. moreover, i only ask could it possible that such masses separated from the sun, may retain some of the nuclear property of the sun, and could this explain the radiation that once had been found at tunguska? eanassir http://universeandquran.741.com
3456	1	a	about as much 'soverienty' legitimation as hitler had when he was butchering the jews. no cause? you forget about trying to murder bush #41. no cause? you forget about him funding palestinian terrorists at $25k a pop. no cause? you forget about invading kuwait. no cause? he kicked out the u.n. inspectors. no cause? he fired at our airplanes who patrolled the no-fly zones. no cause? the mass graves and stalinist government? and these are just the things we know for certain.
3457	1	a	samsung produces apple clones for several years, they have ideas or concepts on they own. it's pathetic and unfair.
3458	1	a	well, since we don't have to treat people equally, i see nothing wrong with making all people ages 14-16 slaves. (i doubt anyone will be against this anyway.) but moreover, since we are not equal, we can make women have pregnancies and disallow abortion. right? now obviously i think everyone is equal. personally i don't see someone that makes 1million a year any different then someone that is homeless. i guess this explains the devaluing of like though :(
3459	1	a	uhhhh... i know he was 40. that's pretty young to die. are you planning to be dead by age 40? quite sure, but he is total hottie!! so it's far worse. wow! are you serious? his death is far worse because he's a total hottie?
3460	1	a	your not commenting. your trying to convince people, you and your point of view is right. your trying to convince people here in the usa to follow your ideas.  is your father an aussie citizen? if he is, then he is no longer a us citizen. no need to answer, just a thought. i am sure your are not a us citizen. so your argument to convince people really does not matter does it? your attempts to convince people you are right and influence our policies sickens me. please take you imperialistic attitudes somewhere else.

3462	1	a	so stop blaming his actions on the right side. a better question. why exactly was this guy not committed to a mental health clinic if he had displayed clear and present danger to himself and others as early as college? he was kicked out of college for being disruptive, he wasn't qualified to join the army, why wasn't he committed? why is it that nobody, not even the liberals, decided he was dangerous enough to drag before a court, determine him mentally deficient, and then lock him away for the good of society? i'll be sure to let the military, police, fbi and secret service, know that you said they're all cowards for being armed.
3463	1	a	let's all listen to one religious book and base our laws off of that, regardless of any other beliefs that may exist, especially when regarding something that has little to no effect on anyone but those directly involved. that makes sense.
3464	1	a	a long time ago - like 2009, 2010, and 2011? this is their current website and has information and footnotes that are being updated like: http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ (updated 1-28-2011) http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/cei.html  (updated july 14, 2011) http://climate.nasa.gov/keyindicators/ (updated 4-18-2011) you know what else they get paid to do? put their lives on the line based on, and in the name of, science. ;)
3465	1	a	its a download link for a pdf file provided by nasa about guadalupe (which i gave you before). but heres an article that might amuse you.you may do more research if you wish though i love how you cling to hope that your god exists. you actually believe that god has no time to help all of the starving people, but does have the time to create guadalupe's eyes. i am really glad that your great being is doing lots with his power.
3466	1	a	it is not the existence of the gay people that moralizing families question. their opposition to them being in the video is not based on that. their view is that it shouldn't be considered a 'family' in the acceptable sense of the term. not that they exist. surely you know this. now, you and i don't agree with that, but the question here is whether or not the school should teach about issues that moralistic ones in peoples' minds, such as this one. imo, they shouldn't. there is a broader issue here. so you think censoring over the issue being a moralistic one is ridicuous, eh? so you'd have no problem with schools teaching that people should go to church? or that male kids can have more than one wife at a time when they grow up? those too are moralistic-based issues to many people.
3467	1	a	originally posted by 99%beef : i am fed up with myself.... is it possible to change who i am?  'hun'? <flush> there's jazy - always going for the bath house fix instead of advising a person to get closer to christ/god to find their niche, purpose, and fulfillment in life. that's why you flaming gays are dangerous. you're always leading people into sin and carnality, and away from god's will. that's exactly what satan wants. congratulations.
3468	1	a	sure keep guns ok..., we will..., thanks..., but..., we were planning on keeping them even if you disapproved. we really don't look towards the french for advice ;)
3469	1	a	too scared to answer the question eh? perhaps more the point is that you're too scared to ask yourself the question: 'why do i care so much about getting points for doing absolutely nothing on a site that gives me no reward?' the answering is terrifying isn't it eh virgin. you aspire to be a psychopath. ok. let's see. the guy in that film killed his family and class mates with a bow. you lurk in a sparsely populated forum collecting points that mean nothing to anyone but you.
3470	1	a	students should pay for their lunches, or bring their own lunch to school.  money used by the school district to pay for free lunches for students is money that could have been spent on more important things like books, teachers, computers, etc.
3471	1	a	you disguting sickening woman! how can you tell a man that about his mum??!!! evil twisted filthy...........
3472	1	a	what six-year old kid actually understands the ramification of such a commitment? especially with god attached? it's indoctrination, brainwashing, whatever word one cares to use for enforced learning not related to education.  and i think you have it a little mixed up, this country is the people.
3473	1	a	Would it be the lawless Cardinal Law officiating at one of the funerary masses for JPII and otherwise serving in a prominent role in all the pomp and circumstance surrounding the pope's death?
3474	1	a	yes, but the title comes with benefits. people will definitely look differently on your resume if they see 'legally united' over 'married'. it's all well and good that everyone has a water fountain, but if that separate water fountain isn't really the same, then it's not fair.
3475	1	a	wouldn't it be nice if you didn't overuse the word oppress. if you really believe that gays are oppressed then believe me you ain't seen nothing in the world as yet. try looking at some countries in the world and you will see what oppression really means.
3476	1	a	nah i always watch the site while im off line as a guest, and i join when there's controversy i am not like my besty prod who stays on 24/7 i just get on every now and then and i got on today to see this scandal. how delicious!
3477	1	a	who is dana and what does he have to do with whether these two countries are alike?
3478	1	a	if we had federal healthcare, everyone would be paying and everyone would be covered. i'm sorry you're the only person in your life you're capable of thinking about. must be lonely.
3479	1	a	nope, you've still missed the point. bolding your repetition won't help, either. you said 'all visiting moslems'. not 'all visiting individuals'. specifically investigating 'all visiting moslems' is discriminatory. investigating 'all visiting individuals' is not - well, it is a bit, but less so - and you would not have got this response if you had suggested as such.
3480	1	a	get a grip will ya... ever heard of fort hood? http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33678801/ns/                                       us_news-crime_and_courts/  and i even supplied a msnbc link just to be sure you would say 'fox lies'
3481	1	a	dude, is that what you do? a large amount of people disagree with you and you act 'shocked' at how that could be possible? grow up.
3482	1	a	wow, lets all clap for that great argument for evolutionism. personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again.
3483	1	a	did you not see the post by obvious child that i answered foundit? how can i be changing the subject when i'm responding to a direct statement made by another poster?
3484	1	a	in fairness, he is accused but not yet convicted. he is a defendant.
3485	1	a	muhammad forced his followers to leave their families false he warned those who did not follow him, leaving behind their families, will be cursed by allah false in yathrib he banished and killed the jews who did not believe in him false - they tried to kill him. i wont bother wasting my time debunking the rest of your diatribe. needless to say, freedomfaith.org is hardly a repudable site. i see critical thinking isn't something you're particularly familiar with. not at all unexpected, i suppose.
3486	1	a	if only you learn this lesson, the world would be a better place. you are only adding to the problem. if only you would realize that you are part of the problem. (;
3487	1	a	agreed. it seems to me, in light of the number of recent child rape/murder cases committed by recidivists, that simone has it backwards and those folks who have no faith in our justice system would rather see ten innocents die rather than punish one guilty person.
3488	1	a	depends.. do you like lobster and shrimp? do you wear linen and wool togather?
3489	1	a	and yet you continue to support the illogic of a potential person having the right to make a slave of a person in being. incredible. and, yes, if i am in a persistent vegetative state, i have authorized my family to direct my physicians to pull the plug. i'm not there.
3490	1	a	i 'personally' feel that sex ed encourages having sex, and not abstinence. they should be taught just the basics, and children if they are interested can talk about it with their parents or older friends. abstinence is not being encouraged, rather shunned. maybe i'm just old fashioned, and 16 at the same time
3491	1	a	dear lisa, i want to tell you you're hot. hot as in every way possible. in fact, you should eat some peyote while you dance the tarantella. the way you smell like a goddess in heat makes me want to email you and ask you if you would consider this proposition: if you'll remove that top button i would have enough nerve to plop my large foot down, showing the massive wart to you. do you like warts? i hope so.
3492	1	a	part of me feels the syrians need to fight it out like every other country did, but the other half feels the war needs to be stopped. if there is an intervention, it needs to be done properly. by that i mean no nato countries. the intervention should be made up of arab un troops in blue helmets. this ensures there are no ulterior motives of the forces.
3493	1	a	i don't think so. i think everyone else is overcomplicating it. yeah, gays can't reproduce. survival to the fittest would indicate that gays should die off, but they are being helped along. if they weren't helped along and were told to rely solely on themselves then they would have no chance of survival. well if that's the way humans work then the gay island wouldn't do any better, unless of course you are saying gays aren't human. but i'm guessing what you mean is if the gays died off and the straight island had it's resources destroyed then the island itself would be worse off, but i was talking more about the people's civilization, not the island itself. sorry about lesbian island. it got hit by 2 earthquakes and a tsunami and sunk into the ocean.
3494	1	a	not if you injure them severely because that would be mighty useless if you don't want them to crawl with their bleeding hands in agony over their mangled, broken legs so they won't be able to work no more. then the punished slaves' agony will serve as an example for all the other slaves so they don't act defiantly out of line like the one you just punished. not to mention the child slaves... i've explained one times too many times why it's a sensible thing to do in ancient times. why is the bible worth defending again? it's worthy defending because you're just as much a radical as neophyte christians. i'll defend the bible from you just as i will defend the scientific method from religious idiots.
3495	1	a	honest. what can i say? if nothing else the bush presidency has shown us that having a president who lies every time he opens his mouth is a bad thing.  she does not have enough background to say for sure. while she has instituted some conservative programs in alaska, she also championed the biggest social giveaway of any state ever. she did not even hide it...jsut taxed the oil companies and gave the cash to the people. that is about as socialist as you get.  cant say for sure on nancy pelosi. she looks like a half trained shimp next to hillary. hillary clinton may be evil,but she is smart.
3496	1	a	i think the obama administration has been working with republicans, and much too much. that's why the bill is what it is. although i think it was feingold who said that obama has gotten the bill he intended to, from the beginning. even worse, as this is not a compromise since there is no public option, for starters.
3497	1	a	okay. that is good. but i was asking who he was referring to. was he talking about you?
3498	1	a	this sounds crazy, but my level of shyness i've found has a lot to do with the whether. when it's nice and sunny, i would stand up in front of a million people if i had to, and whip out my johnson, no problems, barely a blush. if the weather's crappy, i don't know, i just get more reserved.
3499	1	a	if that was all that i said then you might be right. i have spent a fair amount of time discussing the why's and wherefore's of my reasoning. and i did not say that good is god although he is. good does not define god. at least not completely. what i said was that god is good. god is the definer of good and he is good. i have offered a fair amount of analysis. i submit that you think it is 'too easy' just because you disagree with it. ef
3500	1	a	why is it moot? do pregnant women who are choosing adoption suddenly don't have themselves and dependents to care for. if i were pregnant and said pregnancy would prevent me from providing for myself or my son i would end it. the question was why some women choose abortion over adoption. one reason is because the pregnancy is a threat to being able to provide for oneself. and your definition of selfish disgusts me. whooooosh.
3501	1	a	i would love to see the evidence for that. alas, there is none. i think there one italian archelogist who claims he found some drawings that he believes that the 'mount sinia' mentioned is different than generally accepted, but i am skeptical of his claims. there are enough screwballs and religious nuts pretending to be archelogists in israel that it takes more than a concensus of 1 for me to consider something. this guy does seem to be more educated than the vendyl jones crowd in archeology, but still a bit on the fringe. maybe he'll get more attention, and provide a good set of evidence, because it is the people on the fringe that are needed to shift the paradiam.. (then they are visionary, rather than on the fringe).
3502	1	a	well, i just did my top three, a top 10 would have had a bit more variety. i place rw extremos higher than lw ones because they are more likely to call for war, be racist and be homophobic. also, many black panthers are already covered in the racist heading. again, many people are jerks.
3503	1	a	do you even follow the news?? seriously. there have been cases of msnbc being so offensive that even hillary clinton basically threatened to boycott them. geez. as far as huffington is concerned, the site you linked to itself is a good example, and is indicative of the same sort of junk liberals criticize conservative talking heads for. for instance, where were the photos that present tea party protestors in a positive light? why would they want to to take 10 photos (out of no doubt thousands that were perfectly peaceful) that present the worst possible elements they could find? that such doesn't raise a red flag to you speaks volumes.
3504	1	a	the democrats are going to do anything they can to bring down the gop..this is just another 'thing' to bring up to show how 'stupid' america is for putting them in power. just like this delay thing..yeah he might be wrong... but would we know about it if the partisan tables were switched the other way..just crappy politics as usual.
3505	1	a	i served in the united states navy from june 2006 to august 2008 and yet you still crucify me and others just like me because your religion and bitterness toward others has consumed you....
3506	1	a	what 'harshness of life'? my life is a fricken breeze. i don't know what people are complaining about.
3507	1	a	i think it goes without saying that any time the mother's life is endangered then and abortion can take place............ as far as rape and incest if and abortion has to take place lets hope that it is before the last 3 months of the pregnancy........
3508	1	a	uh, yeah. he did, and we do know why he did it. you should read some articles before you participate further. don't you think this is a good example of the pot calling the kettle black? i imagine the fbi has it, since they've reported on it, according to the article that was linked. as well as these lunatic abortion opponents, reported to be still circulating the names of people they've 'targeted'.
3509	1	a	what does slavery has to do with anything? oh i see, pulling the race card .
3510	1	a	He was arrested and spent several hours in a cell when plainly he had not broken any laws.
3511	1	a	not a chance. i'm your worst nightmare; a straight, white, conservative male that votes religiously and sees through liberal bs. :p
3512	1	a	here, this is just for you. watch and listen carefully ;) that would be redundant, as educated people already know about it :)
3513	1	a	if it's really that much, i should have heard about it by now. but maybe, just maybe, i haven't looked hard enough. why don't you post what they have said, since, apparently you have and must (therefore) know where to look to find it ;)
3514	1	a	interesting and so revealing, you are so twisted in your thinking that you equate amoral liberals/socialists as real americans while considering traditionalists like me as less than 'real american'? your sides anti american sentiments are why this country is spiraling into a moral and fiscal decline that we may be too late to salvage for the next generation.  as for making calls and driving your 5 liberals to vote early, if this is even true, sorry, but it's too little to late. the 'real americans' have rejected your messiah's gospel of marxism and will vote out all of the liars who supported his marxist agenda. now bend over and take it like a man because we are on the eve of your reality check. emoticonxbouncer emoticonxagree
3515	1	a	i will out post off you any day of the week pal. i will post so much information your head will spin. some of it may even be related, never know.

3520	1	a	why is the world no all atheist? why is the world not all theist? why is the world not all satanist, christian, good, bad, black, white? simply put, people have their differences. if there was but one person type on the planet, not much would get done.
3521	1	a	that's just sick dude! no wonder you're so f*cked up!
3522	1	a	why would you prefer people to be killed rather than jailed away from society so that their harm is neutralised?
3523	1	a	people have the right to freedom of belief and freedom of speech as long as they are not hurting anyone.
3524	1	a	so your some lonely 60 year old guy who say stuff like 'omg' ? wow my life my life is already turning out better then yours..... and i'm only 15 :) and i'm glad i don't know what a blanket statement is ... so suck on that!
3525	1	a	i'm here to debate not argue, or 'disrespect people by calling them idiots', that only shows your true nature (so called person of god). did you ever wonder why you have such a low disapproval rating in your debates with many so people on this site? look no farther then your comments.
3526	1	a	watch your language. throwing out the f bomb doesn't lend you any weight; it just makes you sound as uneducated and immature as you apparently are.
3527	1	a	the problem with atheism is that man is material just like a rock. concepts do not exist in a rock whey should they exist in man? we are all matter. you can say we are more conplex than a rock, but that does not make a difference; matter can not accout for concepts. yes, www.carm.org is awsome thats an example of ad hominim - attacking the individual instead of the argument
3528	1	a	you agreed with trebor pappy.....now you are back pedalling..re previous post
3529	1	a	i think the real problem is that rick roll is officially dead. i mean, a guy like obama using rick roll? god, i thought it was gay when youtube did it, but now obama... what's next, osama sends a rick roll to iran? i feel bad for the trolls who have been using this to get massive lulz. all this shows is that obama is a gaia bitch and should gtfo my internetz.
3530	1	a	ahh here we go again. the attacking begins, i'm all alone and nobody is backing me up. it feels like it's just me against everyone on the site on this debate.
3531	1	a	they have to land eventually, they can't fly continuously. so that's gravity eventually bringing them down. if we could flap our arms that quick like they do their wings we'd be the same.
3532	1	a	that's not cannibalism. if it were cannibalism jesus wouldn't have walked away from the meal. or did that cross your mind?  the catholic church wasn't the first church, unless you can show me that in the book of acts, or the gospels. it's not what they claim, but what we see in history. i imagine a great many catholics will get to heaven before you will. once again - and get this through your noggin - i base my beliefs on what's in the gospels and the new testament. john 3:36
3533	1	a	america invaded more countries, today has less freedoms (patriot act and so on), of all countries in the world germany is the only one, that hasn't a 'shady' history, cause everything has been come to light and regretted. the us still thinks ( your post as an example) it was/ is a force of good. no 'wiedergutmachung' of american history ( slaves,tortures, drones, dictators)
3534	1	a	'the 'hocus pocus' approach to magic is childish' the way she finds the spells is actually quite creative. the spells are in latin and mean things like 'shoot' or blast'.  i think expelliarmos means to expel (get rid of) arms (weapons).  childish? i think not.
3535	1	a	how should i respond to coming back after some time to be immediately called chisler, con artist, stupid? nevermind my observation that left to your own devices, days go by where you either follow up your own posts or pat each other on the back as you regurtitate canned anti-gun control rhetoric. i calls them as i sees them.  you might recall that initially you pro-gun guys rejected even the suugestion that american semi-autos would be of any interest to the cartels when they could get full autos on the black market. how then do you attribute the fact that 70% of the rifles seized in reynoso last november, the biggest single seizure to date, traced to the us? that's why i posted that story. that's my question for you guys. apparently they have some use for semi-autos afterall.
3536	1	a	wowwwwwww you are so clever. did srom teach you how to do that or did you learn it all on your own?
3537	1	a	while adolf did in fact gain followers that were 'christian', to say that he gained 'christian followers', is in the very least a misrepresentation. this is a lie and can only be substantiated by an athiest website, ie; 'nobelief.com' your insistance that christianity is the great 'evil' in the world, is relevant to the lie you stated above. interesting accusation foundit, you attempt to disparage archangel for his christianity, while you just count the scriptures irrelevant along with every other religious institution, and make up your own morality. frank caliente doing his john madden imitation 'here's a guy who knows so much about so little he can judge the ethics of somebody who actually has ethics, while having no ethics of his own! will brett favre come back, i don't know lets ask foundit66, he seems to know everything about nothing'
3538	1	a	i'm just stating a fact. if your delusional mind wants to read more into it than that, have fun - i can't help it if you get off on that. somehow i knew when i posted it that your delusions would try to find some sort of way to criticize me even if i just stated a simple fact. get a life, aa emoticonxbanghead emoticonxrolleyes .
3539	1	a	unfair to paint all fundamentalist christians with such a broad brush. those making this absurd claim of foreign birth are likely uncomfortable with their president having an arabic name and maybe his african heritage as well.

3544	1	a	yeah but i don't hate gays because they are still people i just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in.  wow i have never seen an atheist who is against gay marriage. i am impressed.
3545	1	a	hinduism has far more gods. they could easily defeat the father, the son, and the holy ghost.
3546	1	a	creationism is a joke dependent on an unproven god. evolution literally happens. it's fact. get over it

3550	1	a	... no, but all arranged marriages are, tada! arranged ._. why is this thinking thing so hard for you? if there happens to be an arranged marriage where everyone lives happily ever after, awsome! but people should have a choice who they spend the rest of their life with. you just have a knee-jerk reaction to defend anything of your culture past or present. you don't see me making similar knee-jerk reactions.
3551	0	a	i don't think it's fair to put the blame on women who wear explicit clothing. there are times when self control is needed. if a man can't exercise that self control, to a point where he rapes a woman, then he does deserve jail.  this is partly right though, women do cause a lot of mixed messages when they go out wearing almost nothing. however, if she says no... it means no. and we shouldn't go around blaming the victim of a sexual assault.
3552	0	a	nonsense. nambla is a criminal organization. at various times they've had articles on their website on how to seduce (illegally rape) young boys. and you and the aclu want to protect that kind of morally and legally reprehensible 'speech'? anyone with half a sense of decency wouldn't touch them with a 10 foot pole. only the radical left thinks that's a good cause.

3557	0	a	yeah, i agree with everyone else who has seen the new batmans. they both literally blew my mind. that is what a comic book adaption is supposed to be, not that silly bs from the old movies. here's the order. 1. new batman movies 2. x-men 3. ironman 4. the first spiderman movie only!!!! 5. superman and honestly, i debate whether to even include superman. below the 5th listed all the superhero movies are dead to me. screw them. and after the first spiderman movie they turned into cheesy suck fests. i watched that scene with the stupid cart on that wire. ugh, i swore to never watch another spiderman movie again, didn't even see the end. absolutely terrible.
3558	0	a	for serious news: http://news.bbc.co.uk for other 'news': http://www.digg.com for science news: http://www.newscientist.com/ some of you guys in the us should definitely give the bbc a try for world news. in terms of journalistic standard and telling the news rather than intepreting the news, they're probably one of the, if not the, best.

3562	0	a	maybe you should subtitle this thread: the right to a school with perfect parents. but that's not public education. you sound as extreme as the people who don't want gay parents in their schools. well, go ahead, dear. have fun tearing each other apart.
3563	0	a	when men are done and promptly roll over and fall asleep..., that monstrosity is what women reach for ;)
3564	0	a	lol. this entire argument is so inane.  it's entirely based on the assumption that the bible is true. obviously that is the fallacy of begging the question.  the bible as a whole is unverifiable, and for all we know was written back in the day by a guy who overdosed on opium.  the idea of rapture is completely irrevelant until the bible is verified as fact.
3565	0	a	what do you think is motivating these scientists to lie to us?
3566	0	a	it's marketing 101. in order to sell something, you have to convince people that they need it. in order to sell religion they convince people that they need it by telling them they are going to hell if they don't buy into their religion. the more things you declare a sin, the more people will be 'guilty' of those things, thereby increasing your customer base.

3568	0	a	i can't tell if you're agreeing or disagreeing with david.  david comes out against intervention in the market, and says crony capitalists want more intervention in the market. obama wants to hand out money to politically connected auto industry players. are you saying david is right, and we need less government intervention in the market, or that he is wrong, and we need the government to give more money to corporations? a 'faux argument' would be a pretend argument, like pretending you are an ardent pro-lifer, and making up terrible arguments, to make the pro-life position look ridiculous. kind of like a strawman except in character.
3569	0	a	because people: can't admit their faults, can't tell others theirs, want to look good to their peers; and because people are selfish...i really find it pathetic...this is why i stopped lying when i was young, because i saw how much everyone else did it, and just saw it as pathetic, and didn't want to be like everyone else...i haven't lied in 1 year.
3570	0	a	i do believe that the predictions are accurate, but i say 'no' for two reasons: one, stopping the event would create a paradox. since the event is stopped, it never happens. if it never happened, then nostradamus never predicted it. the second reason is, in the prediction that correlated to 9-11, skeptics asked why they couldn't stop the incendent. along with point one, i say to them 'how do you know that somebody didn't go to authorities on 9-10-01, and say 'there's gonna be a terrorist attack tomorrow''? if someone cited a cryptic writing dating back centuries as evidence, they would either be laughed at and dismissed, or sent to a mental hospital. edit: sorry about forgetting the poll. i remembered that just as i hit the submit button. i'm half asleep today.
3571	0	a	the most horrid thing in the world is the self iterating nature of fear. people undergo mass hysteria much to easy, which is one reason why i don't like the news, especially fox news.
3572	0	a	oh how arrogant, wikipedia is a grand tool for general information.  are you telling me that tiktaalik fossils, archeopteryx fossils and platypus don't exist, and that using wikipedia is somehow misleading in this sense?  these things do exist and i didn't think it necessary to cite peer reviewed material on such trivial matters.

3577	0	a	i'm incredibly surprised you haven't got it now, especially as you put your stance as 'libertarian'. i am not a libertarian because i want to legalize drugs and prostitution or remove the age limit on alcohol and cigarettes. if the definition of libertarian has became that, the world is seriously screwed up. i am a libertarian because in my country, the taxes are above abnormal. 50-65% for an average salary, and up to 80% for a ''millionaire'' basically no one can be rich in my country. every time i get my salary, i am looking really forward to it. i work hard for my money, but it is tearing me down mentally, that half my money is taken away to pay for some alcoholic who is to drunk to get his money himself. it is killing the working spirit in me, and several others. that's why i am a libertarian.
3578	0	a	not all reform jews are liberals either. i know more than a few conservative reform jews. also there are fundamentalists of every christian denomination, i've even spoken to people who've encountered fundamentalist anglicans. :p orthodox judaism, as i understand it, attempts to perpetuate the same system of law as was delivered by moses, and more specifically the associated traditions of the last 3-4 millnenia. fundamentalist protestantism, meanwhile, sets itself against the christian tradition, such as the priesthood, apostolic succession, the doctrine of transubstantiation, infant baptism. the point i'm making is the rejection of these doctrines does not make the fundamentalist protestant churches any less christian, nor is the rejection necessarily incorrect, and the same principle applies to reform judaism. that is the comparison i was making.

3580	0	a	silly chloe...how can a part of the womens body other than her own mouth cry? :p
3581	0	a	so are you are saying that because she wants an abortion she should have it? then why are you even against abortion? we are talking about a life here not just a fetus. i believe that everyone has a right to live. no fetus should pay the consequences because of a decision made by it's mother. in the year 2000, there were 1.3 million fetus that were killed and the same amount of families were waiting for children to adopt. if you are saying that nothing is wrong if a woman needs an abortion, the you are saying she can have repeat abortions. what if a woman who has unprotected sex and knows the consequences of her actions but later decides she wants an abortion? what is your opinion on that?
3582	0	a	holy shit :( that's why i never take stuff from people i barely know. i know a guy who got tricked into smoking crack.  i successfully quit smoking, and hope to re-kick my caffeine habit. weed was by far the hardest for me to quit, since it kind of immerses you in the subculture. you end up having to cut people off from your life, because peer pressure really isn't a myth. in fact, weed is the only drug people ever try to insist i use. i guess it's because it's perceived as harmless.
3583	0	a	mostly a waste of time. the military prepares you for adult life. whenever you deal with stupid people, you want to kill them. the military will show you how ;)
3584	0	a	'-illegal war in iraq.' whose illegal war? america isn't even there to be at war anymore! we are setting up a government for them! if they are grieving because we are helping the general public to live a more organized life then that's kind of their problem right?  besides; this isn't the debate topic where you should be bringing this up.
3585	0	a	And regarding your fallacious example regarding nylon eating bacteria, are you suggesting that the chemical ingredients that make nylon never existed before man combined them to create nylon? The bacteria works on a microscopic level and couldn't care less what product we have made from those chemicals which it thrives on. So your example is both fallacious and moot.
3586	0	a	for once i find myself agreeing with randomdude. i've been in a church of several christian denominations and never seen a 'holy' bible that was just the nt. i've never been to a church where all the sermons are drawn exclusively from the nt. and i know that most christians embrace things like the ten commandments, which are ot all the way. the ot is a prelude, it sets a backstory for the coming of christ, but things depicted in it (like original sin) are essential to the message of jesus; without the ot, the nt is baseless nonsense - well, more than it is already, anyways.
3587	0	a	i suggest you wait for someone to make a statement then attack/address it, rather than presuming statements that were not made and arguing against them. the tactic you are using is called 'strawman arguments' and is not an effective debating method

3589	0	a	i don't think so. a misguided view on foreign policy is bad, but (by your own admission necesary) criticism of those who lack it and a fierce dedication to free speech wouldn't mean hitchens ' failed when applying it to politics' utterly. and as your defense of mother teresa might imply, the advocacy of his good views far outweigh his negatives.
3590	0	a	actually if it had said '...but have not loved', it would mean that. but it doesn't say that, it says if i am charitable but not loved for it, then helping others is pointless.
3591	0	a	'prostitution is not a victimless crime as there are child prostitutes, and the human trafficking among other things.' the reason human trafficking if prevelent in prostitution is exactly because it is illegal. if you legalised prostitution, supply of (and demand for) native prostitutes will rise dramatically. do you not see that trafficking and child prostitution would actually be lowered by legalising prostitution? 'legalization of prostitution would lead only to ... a further spread of hiv/aids.' again, do you not see how there would actually be a reduction in sexually transmitted viruses if prostitution were regulated and legalised? the majority of problems with prostitution are directly attributed to their illegal status.
3592	0	a	just because you have a drink doesnt mean you automically turn in to some crazy drunk... its called moderation... abstainence doesnt work... we know this because the bible belt has the highest teen pregnancy rate in the country and what do you mean we won that one a long time ago? you realize that weed being illegal is more harmful than good... and i dare you to get into a debate about that because i have so many facts in favor of ending prohibition it will make your head spin
3593	0	a	http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=hero she didnt really risk her own life, it was more a case of in the wrong place at the wrong time. she also did not sacrifice her life. she's still alive. to think she was any more a hero than any other serviceman or woman on the front lines is ludicrous, and to tell the truth, many of them arent heroes either. i think titles are passed around to quickly nowadays. now, if you are defending your mates who are injured from 50 ak-47 wielding terrorists and you fend them all off, in the meanwhile losing 2 ligaments, i think thats cause for the use of the title of hero. jessica lynch? hell no. it comes down to how you interpret what a hero is, for me, she is just propaganda for the bush admin (or was). those who cannot see that are fools imho. drummond
3594	0	a	but you are for abortion in certain cases right? i am only talking to the pro abortionists. if you believe abortion should be allowed you are technically for it. if you are pro choice that implies that you are for the allowance of abortions. if it means this much to you i will change the debate title.
3595	0	a	no it hasn't, that's my point. the constitution gives every free american the right to bear arms.. i fully support that and all other rights . the government should stay out of it, but history proves they won't.
3596	0	a	the minimum drinking age should be lowered to 14 if not 12. the main problem with alcohol is drinking habits, non-safe drinking habits are encouraged by a high age of license due to how alcohol is more likely to be consumed in bulk and away from proper supervision for those underage. laws prohibiting underage drinking fail to do such, and actually end up causing some of the situations they are meant to avoid. rather then alcohol being another part of life, used in moderation around family and good friends well supporting the economy by actualizing more of the demand for it. it is given the allure of the forbidden fruit, consumed as fully as possible whenever possible because its seen as a rare item to behold, and often consumed around shady suppliers or swigged from stolen bottles.

3599	0	a	[quote=toby][quote] the relative context, in this instance, is understood to be the assertion that a moral consensus is limited by a shifting perspective - i.e. changing from time to time and from place to place, etc.  a radical relativist might say that's what attila should do - even assuming you have some heinous behaviour in mind: i'm not. it might be argued that moral sentiments are instinctive. i'm not going quite that distance: i'm saying that moral values are expressions of approval/disapproval that don't arise from rational deliberation, but from the affective part of human nature.
3600	0	a	current us policy is moving towards a 27.5% tariff on all chinese products. with the exception of a few, inefficient but politically protected industries, the us produces few of the consumer goods we now import from china. what we do manufacture is so out of line with labor/compliance costs to be totally uncompetitive even if the chinese doubled their prices. does anyone think the us public, with stagnated wages, understands that move will be a substantial direct increase in their cost of living? is the administration counting on blind patriotism for public approval of again having their wallets lifted? or, does anyone else see this as a move to increase consumer spending in an effort to keep expanding the internal transaction driven gdp? as in the net difference from wholesale to retail price, our usual crisis management style in lieu of long-range planning.  http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050526/...us_china_trade

3619	0	a	what's the point in inviting a bunch of famous people? i say this as a huge fan of deniro's and scorsese's: a dinner party would be not be as intellectually stimulating than if you had, say, descartes and kierkegaard in their place. sure, they've probably a hell of a lot of stories and anecdotes which would prove entertaining, but they're ... they're filmmakers, of all things!

3621	0	a	no, it's because there is no evidence of their existence. for instance, we can not see air, but we have evidence of its existence. the most valid argument is that there are planets that can support life. i say it's valid because this is true (unlike other alien arguments). but this is not a good argument for alien existence because the conditions themselves do not prove life. they just prove conditions.

3644	0	a	this is the question her campaign and the whole democratic party need to answer. clinton has almost no chance of winning the nomination without causing a rift in the party, and she has an even smaller chance of winning in the general.  recent polls say that almost half of all americans have a negative opinion of her, and the reverend wright scandal seems to have hurt obama less than clinton's campaign has hurt her in the past weeks. the longer hillary clinton stays in the race, the less likely it is that the democrats will win in november.
3645	0	a	no benefits for laid-off religious workers - upi.com another example of religion getting special perks that they shouldn't have. and unfortunately, somebody else gets bit in the end. i find it difficult to believe that the religious organizations didn't realize they weren't paying unemployment tax. emoticonxrolleyes when they were busy not paying taxes, did they think that was a tax that they were somehow paying? it sounds like at least some religious organizations recognize the impact of their not paying taxes upon others, and take the responsible route to ensure that they as employers do right by their employees (e.g. catholic diocese of richmond). these people shouldn't have to needlessly suffer such an unexpected financial loss, but in the end it's the church that is to blame. they have been enjoying a benefit in not having to pay this tax, and now it's somebody else who suffers...

3651	0	a	so every republican president for the last 30 years has been a rino...and every republican congressman?  the fact is that government has expanded faster under republican administrations than democratic ones for almost 50 years now, easy.  this shows that, like so many other things, you are completely ignorant of ron pauls position on iran. he does not advocating 'appeasing' iran. see, like out founding fathers, paul believes that if they dont threaten our national security, it has nothing to do with us and we should leave them alone. that costs us nothing. running around the world fighting pre-emptive wars that bankrupt us against opponents who posed no danger to us is not a viable long term strategy.

3672	0	a	to ss, results from new mutations are by definition different from the normal, so your objection makes no sense. no one is disputing that there are serious negative side effects with the sickle cell trait. however, in terms of the reproductive success of families with sickle cell vs those without, the ones with the trait do better overall than the ones without, in areas severely beset with malaria and in times before medicine, despite the negative effects. the positives outweigh the negatives, so the sickle cell trait is therefore beneficial in terms of natural selection.

3686	0	a	you cannot mandate biology. the fact of the matter is, however, that homosexual relationships, themselves, appear to have no positive evolutionary purpose. without effects on the female line, this aberration (for lack of a better word) would have bred itself out of the population long ago. it would be similar to a subset of the population in an animal species suddenly being attracted to another, separate animal species. it would seem to serve no positive purpose. procreation is a positive, useful purpose to any activity in an evolutionary context. sexual attraction exists to facilitate procreation. pleasure during sex exists to facilitate procreation. homosexual individuals have brains that co-opt specific biological functions to substitute creatures that do not facilitate the purpose they evolved to involve.

'white' is only a color metaphor. in reality, the people in europe are comprised from 12 different 'races.' i can name my own; germanic, and celt, slavic, and dinaric(italian-greek) are others as well. each race has its sub-races. germanics and celts are expected to go exitnct in less than two centuries anyhow. i'm helping to speed up the process by not having kids!
3702	0	a	i agree. i do not agree with the implication that these are right, but theuy should not get the heat they do from christians as strong as they do.
3703	0	a	it's between grapes of wrath, for whom the bell tolls, and timeline.
3704	0	a	are you seriously blaming me for the font size of a graphic i found on the internet? lol!! perhaps you'd be better served to take up your complaint with google so they can track down the phantom of the font... it wasn't me:) p.s. who was the biggest band you're referring to??
3705	0	a	easyrider -- that site mentions an archaeologist named p. bagatti. i'm not aware of an archaeologist by that name. i suspect the author may have meant to say 'b. bagatti,' as in father (or padre) bellarmino bagatti (professor, studium biblicum franciscanum at flagellation, jerusalem). (see this link)
3706	0	a	i can personally say all three of the uncharted games are well worth the buy. the third plays out like an action blockbuster, though i cannot say for the prior games.
3707	0	a	well you can thank god for that then, because what you were proposing for single payer was some of the most ridiculous stupidity i'd ever seen. whenever anyone wanted to discuss it rationally you'd just spam the boards with another petition '72% of single mothers support single payer! 84% of single mothers reject raising taxes to pay for single payer! therefore we should go single payer!' i even recall you once berated steve for arguing in his own words instead of linking to a poll to support him. why do you think those numbers are relevant? popularity isn't a magic power that turns bad policy into good.
3708	0	a	you need to simply take a chill pill. remember, just because you're not paranoid doesn't mean they aren't actually out to get you. :p
3709	0	a	how would you save millions? hitler saved the german economy, prevented the spread of communism, and made many important achievements. killing bush, however, will save many iraqis and preserve the american economy and kill off a major terrorist. http://tv.globalresearch.ca/2012/10/bush-and-blair-wanted-war-crimes

3711	0	a	you got it! well not the broccoli thing... http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2009/01/22/flying-car.html  and i think we could invent a light saber.
3712	0	a	good god! i well know the difference between an aryan person and the cult of arianism. there would be absolutely no reason at all to discuss a relatively unknown and ancient religious cult in a junior high level history book. but all sorts of hidden reasons to bring up the topic of aryans in a racist southern state.
3713	0	a	we went to the parade downtown first off, which was actually pretty good for here. after that, we hung out at home for a few hours and then headed up to a friend's cabin at eklutna for a mexican fiesta and some fireworks, fireworks that didn't start until 1:00 in the morning, but they were pretty cool for a private fireworks show. fun day!
3714	0	a	maybe from 1986, i'm a mite older than that. they can't pass a retroactive law now can they? mine still says, 'not for identification purposes'. think they can make that ex post facto? even the county clerk isn't entitled to that information. my birth certificate doesn't have it either, maybe obama's does if we can find the birth certificate and heel print ? when clinton was president, he and lloyd bentsen and his fed chief bundled up all the ss money and sold them off as securities. long before 1986, the ss money was removed from the account and put in the general fund so they could spend it. look up what date registration became mandatory and try not to be too surprised.
3715	0	a	you might look back a little further. people have been warning for the last 30 years that deindustrialisation is a really bad idea, and that loading up massive amounts of personal and public debt is an even worse idea.

3717	0	a	the 9/11 commission omits the presence of molten steel from their official report. it took weeks for rescue workers to water-cool the glowing steel beneath the wreckage at ground zero. it was clearly and prominently visible in a thermal image taken by a usgs satellite on september 16--five days later. in the video, one of the workers states that it has been almost 6 weeks after the attacks, and workers are still trying to cool down the steel. the 9/11 commission and supporters of the official story don't try to make the claim that office fires produce molten steel. they just ignore it.
3718	0	a	at no time did i state the component parts of this seperate, human life, were dead.  thanks for not making such assumptions. we're talking, i remind you, about human life. not sperm life. not egg life. you really need to follow the specific issues here. you'd fail miserably in a court of law...unless you have razzle dazzle... :p
3719	0	a	but of course, if it happens after president obama has his people installed, people who believe in science and research and reality, and these reality-oriented people have taken full control of the agencies who oversee these sorts of things and have made sure that regular inspections are made for food safety. i think you'd better at least allow the man six months to get his people and policies in place.
3720	0	a	haha haters gonna hate. i checked out your profile, and found out u also hate ben walters!!! gotta say, that guy is a complete pillock!
3721	0	a	reagan because he ended the cold war. bush, because he's keeping the terrorist in line.
3722	0	a	characters like our jyosh just want to diminish gays in society, and deny that gays are victims of religious homophobia. this is why he pretends that bullying of gay kids is just a feature of bullying in general (as if blue-eyed kids were routinely bullied because of their eye colour!), rather than a direct consequence of religious bigotry. he can't bring himself to admit the truth there.
3723	0	a	yes, obviously. they didn't follow these #safetytipsforwomen or else they'd have all been fine.
3724	0	a	joe, joe, joe........i'm working to straighten dana out. i think it is a hopeless cause, but i'm trying.
3725	0	a	yet it is a conculsion derived without evidence. it is only based on what is seen in an instant, not what is seen through time. you just proved my point that there is a preconcieved notion. it has been taught to you. (at least, i seriously doubt you have gone out and observed something evolving first-hand). constant mutation in every generation is not something observed. it still would not account for the extreme specificity of nylon. again, the chances of- a random mutation allowing multiple (i assume there was more than 1 survivor) organisms to digest a synthetic material that happens to be dumped where they are- are very much against it
3726	0	a	in defense of the fruit fly, why would one evolve when one is already suited well to their environment? what good does a 7th leg do? and about the experiment itself - please, always post references. who did the experiment? when? under what conditions? how? assuming you were correct about the experiment, were variables put in place such as habitat changes to reflect the timeline you speak of, a large variety of fruit flies to begin with, random mating, etc etc or did some people just shoot some x rays at a couple fruit flies, did some arithmetic which was probably wrong and called it that? and im sorry, but there is mountains of direct evidence for evolution, you just need to go and look at it.
3727	0	a	spain is primarily a roman catholic country.......they will never let the socialists or the left allow gay marriage i nthat country........... you can take that to the bank
3728	0	a	mass. lawmakers delay vote on gay-marriage ban  http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060713/...ghts_gays_dc_1 the anti-gay family groups (mass resistance, etc.) are not happy about this move. time is on our side, as more time passes more and more people are in support of full marriage equality.
3729	0	a	that's really interesting and that would be awesome if i could ask you questions my college course is based on biology so i could use the help xd i can see why it would put you off certain things :)
3730	0	a	the fact is that these countries supplied trained terrorists that hijacked the planes that were used in the 9/11 attacks. the fact is that these countries are hosts of al qaeda training camps your 'proof' that iraq deserves or military onslaught is a jordanian terrorist named zarqawi operating out of iraq. he was a terrorist in jordan before he moved to iraq, and there are still numerous al qaeda training camps in jordan that we have not addressed anyway, you have been asked to show that iraq has a single al qaeda terrorist camp which is protected or acquiesed by iraq
3731	0	a	according to the news he admitted to getting meth from the guy and getting a 'massage' from the guy. but not sex. http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/11/03/d8l5pjlo0.html

3734	0	a	and you, phunting, need a thump on the head from my brolly!
3735	0	a	oh no, a muslim killed a christian. i suppose we should totally get rid of the muslims in this country and ban them forever, n'est pas? nein nein nein! a christian does the same thing, kills some afghanistany, civilian or not, because they're ' the enemy' and he's a hero. because he's one of us, that makes it alright. 'but when them paki bastards come over 'ere 'n start killin' our boys, they can fuck off back to mussy land they can, yeah kill the bastards!' again, no, no no no no! learn to live with each other, this guy did something wrong, he should be condemned, not his whole religion. of course he did wrong and i am not just blaming the racists, it's equally the extremists fault. but all i am saying is, learn to fucking live with each other!
3736	0	a	it isn't one of the crapy ones, its the best one they ever made! did you even watch it? did yooouuuuu????
3737	0	a	i only created one and there is some on here that do want it to be legalized. you need to stop lying to yourself.
3738	0	a	the problem, however, becomes more manageable once you realize that all you need is a computer with a database that shows where all the food/water hoarders live. no such database exists, to the best of my knowledge; certainly not one we could gain access to. and in any event, post-apocalypse technology will be limited to things that operate without electricity, for the most part, so maintaining and powering a computer after the end of the world would be pretty much impossible. i think you need to take your plan back to the drawing board, as it all hinges on this one ill conceived idea.  also, even if your computer idea worked and was a reality, you just told a whole bunch of people about it, so now you have unwanted competition.
3739	0	a	star wars, obviously. star trek has no depth in character, and it's all ab out the cash. star wars has tradegy, love, humor, and everything else ever wanted. what's more to ask for?

3743	0	a	the fact that america needs a republican congress is evidenced by the past records of the two major parties. things take a turn for the worse everytime the liberals get control. liberalism is a mental disorder.
3744	0	a	well.. there have been plenty of jesus' till this day. i just don't believe that a certain jesus came to this planet, born by a virgin, walked on water, died on a cross so people can enter heaven.
3745	0	a	i must say, that first paragraph you wrote really interests me. i've become so accustomed to speaking to hereditary theists that i wasn't sure it was even possible to be religious with atheist parents. if you don't mind my asking, who introduced you to christianity? or was it some sort of overnight process, as in you woke up and just believed through some some divine revelation?
3746	0	a	no, i do not think we would be more successful without the trolls...but, what spam are you receiving?
3747	0	a	those who don't have god as their moral compass are the ones who are responsible for 99% of crimes committed to humanity. what are you talking about? except for communists i can't think of any crimes committed by atheists. as for crimes committed by people who believe in god? pick a war...seriously, pick any war before communism came about and most wars after it and you'll see that in every case the leader of that nation and nearly the entire population of that nation believes in god. honestly you may deserve a prize for having created the most demonstrably wrong statements on this site. congrats!
3748	0	a	my dear, i don't know who first invented the word 'christianist', but i saw it used frequently on andrew sullivan's website, and he's no liberal, just another christian conservative, only not a complete idiot. it denotes the sort of bigots who think that not only are christians better than anyone else, but that everyone else should be compelled to abide by the religious laws desired by christianists. not all christians are christianists. but you can recognise a christianist by his bigotry, and opposition to everyone who isn't like him. christianists believe that the only legitimate government is one that lives by their religious principles. there are lots of them around, virtually all supporters of the gop. that's your crowd.
3749	0	a	if it's any comfort, the same exact reality exists in europe regarding the corporate takeover there. this isn't an american dilemma only, but a global one. if you agree on that level then we do agree for once.
3750	0	a	it does prove mathematically. i provided the necessary formula.  on the second point, technology does cause the price of the means of production and labor to decrease. you're completely right on this. but the thing is, can technology keep up with demand? this is harder than it sounds because we are continually having crises. i found this video which explains things much more in -depth.
3751	0	a	about 61% of abortions are obtained by women who have one or more children. wow that one really blew my mind. can i ask, are these stats done in the us or?
