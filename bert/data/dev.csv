1,0,a,"darling, you're too sensitive. i've never had an issue with your debates. it was a parody of some of the new ones out. you've probably seen them, they ask a question then give yes, because and no, because for the answers when they are clearly not a question that can be answered yes or no. if i had a problem with yours, i'd be enough of a friend to kindly point it out. again, you're cool with me, don't worry.edit: i see where you've seen what i was referring to. it's early here and i'm not yet awake. but i have to get crank-started and get ready for class."
2,0,a,"he'll get to you eventually, he's doing them in order of points. lol though i'm disappointed to say that a lot of people, including myself, are starting to lose interest in the roasts. i'm not surprised though, because there's a lot of inactive users."
3,0,a,"i would never limit myself in a debate to 'how many' generations it takes because the fact is your scientists are afraid to test such things. in the following example it took between 7 and 18 generations for guppies to change their phenotypes. http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releas...sss-270397.php of course these guys, being evolutionsts explain this phenomenon as happening through natural selection -- death. but what have we already learned about tadpoles?? -- they develop in direct relation to their predators....including body structure. fish are no different."
4,0,a,"do away with scholarships, too. oh yes. humans have a natural desire to learn. are ever learning.  besides, you don't need two to three years to prepare for these exams, nor do you need a public high school to help you prepare for them. teachers must assess all the time in order to teach. the issue there is not grades, but assessment. the appropriate methods varying, for different teachers. you believe that, because you don't know anything else."
5,0,a,"i guess that you didn't look at my last link. there are recalls every year that effect millions of cars, and those companies are not being bullied by the government. the point is every car company has recalls, and the government is targeting toyota. ford, gm, buick all have recalls. why are they not targeted? so, the government is the almighty paternalistic big brother punishing those bad and irresponsible companies who only care about themselves and wreck endless destruction to society and the environment. no, toyota is committed to fixing faulty accelerator only because of accusations for causing accidents."

9,0,a,"for someone who puts importance on the ability to think i'm surprised that you believe mentally handicapped people are as valuable as the average person. value is of course the key word here. value can be interpreted to mean many different things including value to the human society. even the humanistic perspective has to take into account that the human society as a whole even if it is only a small portion. i don't think the handicapped can hold a great deal of value in the human society when compared to the avereage 'intelligent and able-bodied humans', wouldn't you agree? if so then where do they make up for this imperfection to increase their 'value' to be equal to that of an able-bodied human?"
10,0,a,"i'm not surprised you would say this. it is the statement of a person who would want power and control over a woman's womb, which, btw, inoygdb."
11,0,a,"marriage is social support. the government, in supporting marriage, is giving social support to certain relationships covered by marriage.  you argue marriage should be left up to the culture institutions such as churches, government should only do the paper work. that's an acknowledgment of the current social role of government recognized marriage. you don't want government to provide that social support, suddenly, now that it will include gays. oh yes, it speaks to the cultural relevence of government-recognized marriage. people would not feel sufficiently compelled to change the constitution over a matter of meaningless government paperwork which has no social relevence."
12,0,a,"i'm not disputing the numbers, and i'm certainly not disputing the fact that bush won.  what i'm intrigued about is the razor thin margins, to my mind anyway, that characterize the us election system. don't you find it the least bit odd that it's been 30 years since a president received a plurality? waxy"
13,0,a,"fair enough. i tend to run skeptic. i am surprised that i am a theist. if you were to believe in a god, which would it be?"

19,0,a,"my parents moved to shawnee not long ago. when i was a kid, anything west of lenexa was considered too close to desoto, and a little suspect :) i was up that way not long ago, and even deoto is fairly respectable now :) :)  i am surprised there are so many here from kansas. there is somebody here from lenexa as well."
20,0,a,"oh yes we can. invoking god is not an explanation for ultimate origins, it's the papering over of the absence of an explanation by declaring further application of the question off limits. simply declaring that god's origin doesn't need explaining does not make that so."
21,0,a,"i love that you guys dont seem to be joking when you talk about it being offensive to gays - if anything i would think only tom cruise would find it offensive - because of his claims that he isnt gay (obviously untrue) gays would probably cheer if he (along with his penis) would come out of the closet if someone would find this offensive, it wouldnt be me vs gay guys - it would be me vs overly sensitive and selfrighteous guys who happen to be gay"
22,0,a,wow what an awkward discussion. there is obviously no reason to sterilize when they are sexually retarded as opposed to mentally retarded and even then mentally retarded can have non mentally retarded children and some of them are able to take care of their offspring depending up the severity of their condition.

25,0,a,Well that explains your anger.:p I hope you are blessed with homeliness.:) Makes your commitment easier to keep. How old are you now?
26,0,a,"yeah even i have to agree you were making a joke. i may not agree with your stances on things, but i can see when you're joking."
27,0,a,"i'm in total agreement with that statement. unfortunately, parents are passing that mindset on to their children. the us experienced a decline in college enrollment in 2005, which speaks volumes about us lower education and personal motivation, at the very time other nations have accelerated their production of graduates in science and engineering. we'll end up paying a dear economic price for that circumstance.  on the bright side, we have a large surplus of business majors to manage our service industry, the down side being their lack of basic reading and writing skills."
28,0,a,"to be honest with you, i'm mildly amused at best."
29,0,a,"really? wow! my parents did the same thing! we had a water-cooler bottle that my dad put change into for years, and when we were little kids we went to cash it in, all of us helping to roll the hundreds of pounds of coins, and it ended up being worth over $900! ever since then, i've been a coin fanatic. people are so quick to throw away change. my friends know that i'll always take a nickel or a few pennies if they don't want to carry them around."
30,0,a,"gay dreams are pretty common among men, but it doesn't make them gay erm.. you've had dreams about having sex with men? i think you're kidding yourself if you think that's normal for a straight guy."
31,0,a,"that is a poor argument. if you want to become better at debate, in general, don't make statements you cannot back up, but never say that your using 'what i've been told' as an argument. your opposition will tear you apart. :)  lol, it's not like i care that much for this debate, but i will take that into consideration :) i am impressed with your willingness to debate any topic with an open mind compared to many others i have seen on this site and would enjoy debating you in a more formal structure. if you agree, of course. thank you, and of course. i'd love to debate with you."

35,0,a,"@ raastee: i've glanced through your paper: i'm surprised you were allowed to get away with the sentence, 'irrationalism is a fallacy to be avoided'. irrationalism is not a fallacy: a fallacy is an apparently genuine but really an illogical argument. irrationalism, outside number theory, is merely a discourse or statement inconsistent with the use of reason."

43,0,a,"it depends on what kind of faith you are talking about. do you mean 'having faith' in actual things? if so, then most definately. although the world can sometimes be a cruel and horrible place, it can also be a fantastic one, and seeing that (as i'm an athiest) gives me some kind of 'faith' in the human capacity, society, etc (where as a religious person may well have the same reaction for their faith in god)."
44,0,a,"i don't know if you're joking or not but you made me laugh, thank you :)"
45,0,a,i have a reputation to maintain. most people stay on this site for about a year. i've been here for almost 3 years now? i guess you haven't learned that you shouldn't try to teach a pig to dance. nor have you learned that you shouldn't wrestle with a pig. you can't win and the pig likes it ;)
46,0,a,oh yes i forgot there are some who believe that the property of free-will permeates the universe and is shared by all things animate or otherwise. there is a mathematical proof floating around someplace of it. but since i do not think that there is in fact such thing as free-will i have not bothered to collect it. humans do not have free-will simply because there is nothing for human will to be free of.

55,0,a,yeah but i don't hate gays because they are still people i just hate the sin and the lifestyle that they are in.  wow i have never seen an atheist who is against gay marriage. i am impressed.
56,0,a,"you seem to be lost in our jokes, you have to tell people you're joking so they know. and you got the punctuation wrong, in the russian phrase. the only way for it not to sound insane in russian, would be to put it as: '___ _ __. __'. calling someone '__', means things are serious, and you're ready for a fight. if you claim it to be a joke, you're just insane. so i assume that you got the punctuation wrong, and it was your signature."

59,0,a,"i feel the opposite is true. i feel a lack of hierarchy adds complication to the layout. it's pretty functional don't get me wrong. freaking cool site, but i mean you have all this opportunity to explore hierarchy and color (brand = two colors, blue/orange, arguments has 2 choices...). they even dabbled in it a little with the 'add argument' buttons above. the grid structure of the layout seems mildly confusing as well. for instance, the vertical alignments of usernames with their respective arguments could match up more uniquely to aid in clarity. or if the leading (space between lines of text) wasn't so consistent, each 'argument' might be better framed visually, without the addition of graphics or color. obviously, this is not gospel or some fantastic soultion, i just think lack of color could be one of a few ideas on improving clarity and functionality of the site."

66,0,a,"alright, i think i see your point know. however, i think the only way in which conservatives would be socialist is that they're soo capitalist they end up effectively swinging back to the other end of the spectrum by making people want to kill them. which is a silly argument because the proletariat ain't never rose up and not settled for simple tax breaks or what have you. furthermore, i'm intrigued by your fascism point, i'm just wondering how it affects the debate. are you saying that essentially all political ideals can effectively be reduced to the same ideology at their basest level?"
67,0,a,reckon you don't know much about christianity then.  when you can bust the resurrection of jesus christ then you might have something to argue about. until then your claim that christianity is untrue is simply a lot of hot air.

73,0,a,"i am surprised at your response since i see your posts as well considered and stated. i asked the question and you answered. to me it was clearly, by definition, inflammatory. we can agree to disagree and let readers make their own determination."
74,0,a,"oh yeahrubbish rubbish,scientifically speaking, human life (using a most bsic term) begins at conception. the twins exist as two seperate entities the moment each contains the individual human dna. seems to me you better be certain when it begins before you go around ending it. if you are driving at night an you ""think"" you might see a person ahead in the middle of the road you are hopefully not gonna drive over that person. Instead that uncertainty should lead you to stop. If you dont like that example, consider a hunter who is unsure what is in the bushes."

78,0,a,"however, just because the majority of people share something in common doesn't always mean the truth? very good. philosophers call this type of argument 'argumentum ad populum'. it is a fallacy that many people are prone to commit. you can choose a sonnet and correctly pick's its emotion but you can never be so sure i agree. shakespearean scholars often disagree about very miniscule details. but i think just because they are not 'sure', that doesn't mean that they can't be certain. maybe you could go google 'shakespeare sonnet 1' and read just the first poem of his sonnets collection. tell me what you think! i'm sure that shakespeare will charm you like he has charmed so many."
79,0,a,"That's is ridiculously poor logic. Simply becuase the church makes mistakes doesn't mean it's incorrect in all other charges. The US government is WAY more corrupt than the Catholic Church, and yet we obey every god-damned thing big brother makes us do."

81,0,a,"pro-choice is a sexist concept. it only applies to women. pro-choice doesn't give you much of a choice. it sounds like what you're saying is that anything that has to do with only one gender, is sexist. if not, please clarify.  pro choice does give you a choice. you can either continue the pregnancy, or seek an abortion.  the pro life argument eliminates abortion and mandates that you continue the pregnancy (barring rape, etc).  if you're joking, then ignore this."
82,0,a,"yeah! its a benefit to be able to do a thing like that. i'm amazed that we've come so far in technology and science, but i think there is a line of what we can offer people. its not like they're gonna chose whether they want to have an egg or a bagel for breakfast."
83,0,a,"So according to one of the people who conducted the study don't go using their results as a tool for arguing against abortion.One woman I know had an abortion a short time after she was married. I also know she has regrets that she had the procedure. I considered what she had to say about her experience and thought about the 14 year old son she now has. From what she told me, I could plainly see she would never have had her son if she had not had her abortion as her circumstances would have changed beyond recognition. Perhaps she gets depressed about the child she never had because of her abortion. However, her son is a fantastic boy whom she loves very much. So we cannot simplify in quite the way you seem to infer that we can."

107,1,a,"irrelevant. what about the common people that weren't blessed with god's son? revenge: definition, synonyms from answers.com tr.v., -venged, -venging, -venges. 1. to inflict punishment in return for (injury or insult). 2. to seek or take vengeance for (oneself or another person); avenge. n. 1. the act of taking vengeance for injuries or wrongs; retaliation. 2. something done in vengeance; a retaliatory measure. 3. a desire for revenge; spite or vindictiveness. 4. an opportunity to retaliate, as by a return sports match after a defeat. tell me, simone, how exactly does using force to defend oneself qualify as revenge? revenge is tracking down the person that wronged you and cutting their throat when they're at their most vulnerable. revenge isn't killing your attacker because you're in fear of your own life."
108,1,a,"So lets see, you referred to how the 1st amendment applied to the states, posted the 14th amendment privileges and immunities clause and then asked if I thought something was unclear. Of course the privileges and immunities clause is often mistaken to have incorporated the 1st amendment by people who don't know what they are talking about but this is merely coincidence because you randomly quoted part of the 14th amendment but implied it all. Now if I changed it to what it said above would you feel that is an accurate statement? Probably, considering you don't seem to understand a blatant difference between ""original understanding"" and ""original constitution).Your pride ruins you my friend."
109,1,a,"what country are you from? in america the people have never had the ability to decided law. the legislature writes it, the executive approves it, and the judiciary interprets it. the people have no direct say what so ever."
110,1,a,"Dude, you only figured that out now? I'm disappointed in you. just joking. Everything he states has a hidden agenda."
111,1,a,"so why have darwinists ignored symbiosis for decades if it was so compatible? same with developmental biology? why have developmental biologists been locked away in closets, never to be heard from until recently when they've forced themselves upon the scientific community? the reality is you have no choice: accept that organisms cooperate with each other and respond purposefully and intelligently to the environment or else. tell me though: do you now admit that individuals evolve, not populations?"
112,1,a,"'lame apologetics'? well, i guess if you say so, with your invincible assurance of being right whenever you open your mouth, it would be futile to contradict you.  at least you haven't accused me of being 'prejudiced' against science.  james."

114,1,a,"show me the post where i want a theocracy or eat it.  back at you.  god creates life in a mothers womb (psalm 139:13, etc.).  you can't stand the truths in the bible, can you? you have to hem and haw and do a barack obama and try to spin it away. it's not working for you, pappi. jesus is the resurrected savior and god creates life. and you can't stand the truth."

116,1,a,Really? Why don't you go out and start randomly hurting and killing people and see how far that argument gets you in court.
117,1,a,"You call me or a family I may have, a perversion(sorry the word was ""perversity""), but that is not hate? I believe I am probably younger than you, but that doesn't mean I was born yesterday."

119,1,a,"The truth hurts doesn't it? They are anti my morals, anti my family, anti my equality, anti my america, and defintely homophobic and I would add one more bigot."
120,1,a,"because gc hears things all woggly. the message from god is for shepherds to tend to ignorant, mindless sheep. but, with dope-smoker ears, and american ignorance it translates into a cowboy...who rustles cattle...and heads them to a quick slaughter. it's like, when the anti-chist makes his appearance, i'll be gods slaughterman. effectively and efficiently removing tru-believahs from the world...cause god forgot some in his rapture thingy (i forget how the logic of these events is supposed to play out...) ummm...aren't we overdue for that bloke to return already? i'm getting antsy for the 2nd coming and all the excitement that leads up to that glorious event. think holding my breath will make it happen any sooner?"
121,1,a,"behavior dictates risk. some practices are 'more risky' than others. but to say gays are more prone to hiv infection, suggest that heterosexuals are immune, or less prone...which is factually false. role models?? what are you talking about? you don't even know.  old camp fruits? you've lost the little mind that you had.  your daddy is more of an 'old camp fruit', than i ever could be, girlfriend.  and i'm in a monogamous marriage for the past 10 years. i need no announcements. you?"
122,1,a,"not true at all. hate crime legislation protects straights as well as gays. nothing 'special' there. so you make a claim, but can provide no example to document the veracity of your claim. meh... what i expected. the ruling is garbage. 'ex-gays' are supposedly straight, right? so they are already protected under existing legislation. if we had a bunch of democrats who changed to republicans, and then insisted they should be known as 'ex-democrats', would we need another legal status for them? no."
123,1,a,"So let me get this right. To counter Accipiter's statement that you have the intellectual maturity of a 10 y/o, you string together a bunch of words that you don't understand in context that makes absolutely no sense? Point - set - match Accipiter."
124,1,a,"oh, so business owners don't make 'real' contributions to society? whoa boy, slow down there. i didn't say that government offices should be passed down. what are you going to do...make inheritence illegal? you didn't read my answer obviously. just because people have money doesn't mean they have to share it. the government doesn't have the right to take money away from the rich and give it to the poor. so what if rich people don't give money to the poor! it's their choice. god tells us to give money to the poor, but he also gave us a free will. it's not the governments responsibility to help the poor, it's the church's responsibility."
125,1,a,really? i never miss the chance to tell everyone that i'm going to heaven? i challenge you to quote me ever bragging that i'm going to heaven and you're not. what i have done is promised you mockers and scoffers that the day will come when you will learn the truth about how wrong you are to reject the living god. but never have i boasted that i am going to heaven while you're not. and never has my motivation for promising you that you will ultimately learn the truth been to make such a point. so quote my posts kronus. prove me wrong and defend your lying claim. and i want links to posts in context to the debate and point being made at the time.
126,1,a,"How do you know it is him? It's a simple question. IF he is writing as Lurch, and someone else comes onto a board, as Ungerdunn, who is just as rude (which is what you are saying), you assume it's the same person? Or, is it because they both claim to be biologists? I guess that having another person enter a forum, and claim to be a biologist would narrow it down to just the same person emoticonXClown All you've done is said you know it is him because one writer is as rude as the other... and that this gives his identity away by some mysterious process, probably I don't understand this as I've never read set-theory! emoticonXWow What should be a very easy question becomes you repeating ""I know it is him"".Also, has he been banned as Lurch on these other fora?"
127,1,a,"black unemployment is at 19 -20%. the economy is in the toilet, as are obama's approval ratings. and you're swilling kool aid and saying you know best? lol! that's why you liberals are dangerous. you're too steeped in folly to understand what's going on. how's that hope and change working out for you? emoticonxbouncer epicurus apparently never read the book of revelation where god levels the evildoers. and you look up to that? what's the matter with you? you didn't read it either to know epicurus is three sheets to the wind on that? that's why you liberals are dangerous."
128,1,a,"Ok, so if we are going to let everything take the ""normal course of nature"", then lets just let everyone die. Have cancer? Too bad, its the natural course of nature that you die. What about heart failure? Sorry, no paddles of life for you. We're going to let nature take its course. Just like your beloved pope, nature is not always right."
129,1,a,"whoa! duo. give the kid a chance. it seems that you are skeptical that he can offer empirical 'proof' that his god exists. certainly, since he is a 'philosophy and theology' major he must understand the implications of 'proof' in the context of science, as well as the meaning of the term 'empirical'. after all, wouldn't those ideas be something that a philosopher would be expected to understand? so let's await his 'empirical proof' without laughter. wait until he presents his 'empirical proof' before we laugh."
130,1,a,"so you reference shakespeare to explain the song of solomon? seems rather convoluted, but whatever."
131,1,a,"sorry your mightiness, thank you for your graciousness of addressing us common folk.  are you really that obtuse? i swear you and easy share a brain. i clearly pointed out that this commandment talks about respect for authority. personally, i think this applies to single parents, families with 2 daddies, or children raised in an orphanage.  yet i bet somehow in the formative years of the children, they are taught some form of respect for authority.  how so? i didn't write it, i'm just commenting on it. and again, i prefer to replace 'mother and father' with authority. regardless, who says respect = fear? maybe you and easy really do share a brain...you both seem to think you can define words as you see fit to lend creedence to your arguments."
132,1,a,"You still don't get it do you, Smiley... emoticonXBanghead If cupcakes were human? It would."
133,1,a,"apparently you need to read up on up-to-date cases of fetus viability and premature birth success statistics. that's right, and she does it after the baby is born by caring for it as well. so? i guess you'd also be in favor of it being legal for a mother to not allow her baby to live because she has to care for it after it's born too, with that reasoning. there are many, many women in the pro-life movement. my wife is one of them and she is a lot more passionate about it than i am. (trust me, you don't want to be in a room with her after you've killed a baby!) if you think this is a men versus women issue, you are sadly mistaken."
134,1,a,Does she shampoo your beard and iron your turban too? Towel head.
135,1,a,"so, you admit defeat to a child? you have no argument and can only name call. answer my posts with something other than ad hominem or admit defeat."
136,1,a,"have you ever even heard of www.google.com? http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=...e+search&meta= and this is your measure of what makes something true? well then, the epic of gilgamesh, the illiad, and the oddysey must also be true by that reasoning. they've survived just as long, and are still being studied to this day for their insights into those ancient cultures."
137,1,a,a bit over the top here eh? quicksand?...butcher babies? wow...very sensational... i have a question for ya ez? do you own any slaves? do you have a beard or long hair? have you stoned any non-virgin brides lately. seeing as though you are so adherant to the bible....i figure you at best have smited a neighbor or two this week?
138,1,a,yeah and i suppose being confronted with reason is a challenge for you too... i mean hey i don't call your marriage a lie or your wife a whore but you can do the same to my significant other? tidings of comfort and joy to you too scrooge...
139,1,a,"Indeed, a coward I might be, but alas you have anonymity!Sorry if I wax lyrical. How do you know what I've done with my life? I know you think yourself clever, but do you really think you are that clever? Wow!"
140,1,a,"every single time you make the assisinine statement 'the baby isn't the woman's body' you downplay the part the woman's body plays. maybe it isn't the body - but it can't live without the woman's body. the owner of said body should be making decisions for said body.  when you are willing to force pregnancy against the will and without the voice of the woman who is pregnant - you are hi-jacking her body. i forget - are you one of those force the rape victim to carry the baby lifers? pretty close and i will fight you hard if you try trample one inch of it.  i still don't give a damn what they may or may have not have thought about abortion, nor was that an argument i was trying to make."
141,1,a,"not to me, but let's not quibble about things we can't change. let's talk about something that we can change...for a change. we could argue about it forever and never change one thing that's written. how about making a proposal suited to fit those whose religious beliefs tend to make us feel inferior? or passing legislation that more medical staff be trained in 'special' fields of medicine for certain diseases so that constant referrals won't bounce us off the walls."
142,1,a,"steve if i thought i could help you i would. i was called on using incorrect facts and your shooting out words like bagillion? you need to know when you in a dream. reality is scary i understand that.  i can't make a blind man see steve, if i could i would. seems you can't make an aware man sleep as well."

148,1,a,i am looking for you to recognize that a pregnancy can't successfully happen without addressing the circumstances of the mother - whatever those may be. you can dismiss everything but health/life of the mother but i can pretty damned well assure you she won't. and whether you like it or not - the pregnancy can't succeed without her. get it? she is not a barbie you can bend to your will with law. do you see her? do you recognize that babies grow and live inside women? address all her issues or you will fail in your endeavors. oh - and i don't require your sympathy - my life is great.
149,1,a,"But I suppose this is all MY/Our Fault too. Huh Brady?First all of Mexico's violence was my/our fault until it was found out that the ATF was actually running guns into Mexico, now what some slimeball does in Norway is my fault. Get a clue."

151,1,a,"as to the first part, i answered you above. regarding the second part; what in the world are you talking about? girls who are born from unfertilized eggs? and boys born of virgin mothers? can you post any evidence of these cases? beside jesus of course, because we know his father is god and that he possesses the holy spirit."
152,1,a,"we'd have define consensus first. if it is 50% + 1 then there probably is one. then after that, who is saying they are wrong? prejudice as its finest. lesz likes to stereotype people to an extreme that can never be changed. i have never told lesz my views on global warming and lesz has shown no interest in gathering facts about what others believe."

154,1,a,"what the heck? owning an airport is evil now???  it is becoming clear at this point that you're pretty much grabbing at anything you possibly can, no matter how silly, to bash jerry falwell. he did enough bad things to where you don't need to resort to the benign things, to bash him. the man is gone. you don't have to worry about him anymore. move on."
155,1,a,"EZ. That is not what I said.I would think a Bible website would be good for biblical information, but for archaeological information? not so much.If you want to provide archaeological evidence of the Exodus, why don't you seek out information from an archaeology sources? Please answer this.If I wanted to seek archaeological evidence to confirm something that happened to a people that was written about in their ancient writings, I wouldn't seek a specialist in the ancient writings as a resource, I would seek an archaeology expert. Doesn't that make sense?"

160,1,a,"other than showing your ability to bold your false or irrelevant claims what was accomplished here? as for the date that the nt books were written, more importance could be given to those guesses if any still existed or if early christians could have refrained from changing the word of god. sorry current christians do it also so unfair to blame just the early ones."
161,1,a,"i don't know, terran. are you scared poohbear? do you actually have any evidence to bring to us? we'd love to see some! really we would! if you could show us some hardcore, physical evidence that proves god did it, it would be the scientific revelation of the century! oh what's that? you don't have any? not even a poorly crafted straw-man argument? damn, and here i was thinking you were capable. oh yes, and if you could give us some firm, solid evidence that darwin is burning in hell, we would all drop our copies of origin and bow down the lord.  whats that? you don't have any...?"

165,1,a,really? is the aaas a non-scientific organization too? hope you don't read the journal science because it isn't good enough for you.  you just choose to attack the source because it disagrees with your viewpoint. don't let science get in the way of your fanatic beliefs. emoticonxgood  if it isn't a peer-reviewed journal than why does it have to be reviewed by two experts in the field? why is the journal associated with the aaas? why do you attack the source and not offer one that supports your view? is it because you can't provide evidence for any claim you make or because you enjoy the taste of sand? keep digging that hole dane.
166,1,a,"'define'? as if it's a definition? tell me, archie: precisely how ignorant of this topic are you? so you want me to give you the better part of what could amount to a semester-long advanced college course in a single post? do you really think that you'll understand curvature of space-time as induced by matter when you can't even understand the difference between a scientific theory and a drunken guess? do you really think i have any inclination of trying to tell you about the technicalities of relativity when you don't understand that light and gamma rays are the same thing? get real. you need to get your head out of your xxx before you'll be able to even hear me."
167,1,a,"if reality conflicts with the bible, there are people that tend to 'reinterpret' the bible so that to them it agrees with reality. this is inexcusable in my opinion. to me, the very fact that they convince themselves that the bible says something it doesnt is worse than simply admitting that the bible contradicts reality. what is the point of depending on the bible for truth when youre going to interpret it to suit something entirely contrary? its like telling your kids that the moon is made of cheese, and then later when confronted with contradictory evidence, rather than admit you lied, you tell your kids that they misinterpreted what you said."
168,1,a,whatever happened to the unborn baby? No consulting him or her I guess. Even though the unborns body is being is the one being torn apart.
169,1,a,of course you can pass that sort of opinion off and some people actuall believe it. how on earth it can be tested? i guess we're only going to respect the sweeping generalisation a typical atheist trick!
170,1,a,"yes, how silly of me to debate him on 'points'. i should debate him on .... what? and here you are again criticising one side, and not the other. he was insulting; you remained stony silent. because he denies that darwin ever used it. darwin did. small point but he entered into all sorts of highly spurious rationales rather than accepting this point (again you were stony silent on this) what is evolution? what is evidence? well that would be a first time. but why ask now, after several days, after he's gone by the wayside, after he made the claim again and again and again? you made no statement while he was claiming this false claim? why your sudden interest in digging all posts i've responded too?"
171,1,a,you kind of made a good point here... both the government and the church have ulterrior motives for 'helping the poor': the politicians hope to gain votes and the church hopes to gain converts...both groups of suckers will be paying back for the rest of their lives in one way or another.  and the church collects more of 'it's own money' to purchase more poor sinners. both groups are indentured servants to their masters. what do you mean 'generous with your own money'? isn't that what the government is? perhaps the christians don't want to help all the poor - only those who belong to their church or those willing to sell their souls to it. both are doing a terrible job of 'helping the poor'.
172,1,a,the liberal propoganda army is on the way? the man  must be lonesome!
173,1,a,"fend not really. they took it out because it was a blatant pro-christian argument.  and those two threads only serve to prove my point. the only iders are fundamentalists christians or muslims. there is no science in id. only godiddit.  explain to me how the same processes that date geological areas that are used by evolution and the big fossil fuel corporations is wrong.  explain to me how its correct when the fossil fuel industry uses it to find fossil fuels but when scientists use it to support evolution, it's false. that makes no sense whatsoever.  explain to me why something tried and true needs to be reformatted. or are all these products science brought us fake?  the delusion of creation."
174,1,a,"Oh spare me the condemnation ya' XXXX-hard. You aren't interested in saving souls.

179,1,a,"if homosexuals don't think, how can they choose to become good vaginal penetrators? the fact is, the more homosexuality there is, the less abortions. if you were a gay you could rest assured that your man-wife would never abort once. are you willing to sacrifice the lives of billions of innocent children to your personal feelings like lust towards vaginas?"

181,1,a,"is hillary clinton a truthful politician? perhaps 'truthful politician' is an oxymoron. if her robust commentary on the iranian regime isn't just an attempt to appease (some) republican sentiment in her bid for the presidency, then she should state what 'clear and unequivocal' policy she recommends that the united states should adopt in order to deal with the threat from iran. i don't think she will make clear what aggressive option she favours, if any - at least during her presidential campaign - on the grounds that it might offend (some) democratic sentiment. james."

187,1,a,"since your denying it so strenuously, i can only conclude you therefore support the right of gays to marry the partner of their choice and to enjoy the same benefits you and your spouse enjoy. or was there some other portion of my post that is contradictory to your beliefs? aw, how cute! archie learnt a new word: projecting. how is what i said 'projecting' archie?"

There's scores of you guys defending such iniquity at any given time. Just look at the last twenty posts and it's five or more of you pro-gay pundits vs. one or two respondents. Seems to me it your cause to promote and defend, just like we're seeing across America. Make you guys a deal: You shut up about it and it will greatly please me to never mention it.

213,1,a,"who decides which portions are appropriate for literal interpetation? how od you know they are right? has it ever occured to you that the whole invisible man in the sky thing is probably not a good canidate for literal interpetation?  perhaps, as the roman elite at the time claimed, the bible was compiled, and christianity was heavily pushed, primarily as a method of controlling the people. we know the bible was heavily edited. we know that much of it was written decades after the events occured, and not by the folks claimed. isn't literally interpeting anything that fraudulent a pretty poor idea?"

222,1,a,"I already have, hence the explanation I provided. If you challenge me to show you an error then I will. Did you expect me to try and show something that was true and see if I could convince you it wasn't?

It is very difficult sometimes to cover it up.And stay away from those shrimp, eagles, gays and snowmenThey are all abominations."

225,1,a,"wow, that's a huge blanket statement which you haven't bothered to qualify. guess that means it's just a personal attack because you had no better argument, huh?  just because someone does not like what society has become does not necessarily mean one hates the concept of structural society. unfortunately you haven't qualified either concept in your ad hominem attack of jake."

227,1,a,"go out there and find all kinds of democrat-led, black-led, white-led, mexican-led, etc.. efforts to protect gay rights. just because you can't find them doesn't mean they're against them. saying all republicans are against gay rights because one of them is, is bigoted, stereotypical and childish. quite moronic too. is it also your claim that all blacks are prejudiced because they haven't formed the naawp yet? grow up."
228,1,a,love vs. pepersack again? what you don't realize is love got her gun.
229,1,a,"True until proven otherwise eh? Xcaliber and you must get along great.You have things backward and you are probably being confused by the 'experiment to falsify a theory', that is a tenet of science based on the generalization that untrue theories are easily disproved.No logician (and by extension no good scientist) would ever hold a lack of disproof as proof.Oh right theories are never proven, so in fact your definition of theory would go something like this -> 'an idea that is not disproved which we assume is true'."

231,1,a,"Nice try, but no cigar. I never said that inflation had no effect. Of course it does. But even factoring in the alleged 500% inflation since the 1960s or whatever it happens to be depending on calculation does not account for the huge run-up in the price of crude to nearly $80 not that long ago. My beef has been the resident ""experts"" here who flout their supposed knowledge and money to impress us lesser mortals who reminded them of the iron law of supply and demand. That, by the way, is found in Economics 101. But you knew that, didn't you?So now, it's a ""technical"" correction. What's next? Some wisdom from Joe Granville or the Elliot Wave Theory?Ball in your court."
232,1,a,"so you are saying that this country is based on principles of judaism? that is a date, dummy. it is not a founding principle. it was how dates were done. and 'our lord' could have been mohamed for all you know, except that it was the standard for dates. no christian principles. so at least you admit that you can't give a single location and that you can't even tell me how many times god, jesus, and religion are mentioned."

234,1,a,"your truth?? your truth???? does it come in singles or in a bundle? do i get some sort of discount for being agnostic, that's halfway between theist and atheist, ja? does it cost extra to buy the 'be judgmental and condescending, and you will enter heaven' version, or can i just buy the 'i have so many flaws, but when they are exposed or i'm out of hand, i'll just fall back on jesus, and that makes me perfect and whole' one? nah, i'll be satisfied with 'the truth that i know is truth, not faith. let's just skip the faith process.' that hits the spot!"
235,1,a,"that's not what the bible says. you're playing word games. what next? numerology??? i mean, i can play around with interpreting too. i can take 'roses are red, violets are blue' and interpret it to mean just about whatever i want it to. let's see, roses represent love, and red is the color of blood. a key characteristic of violets is that they have small flowers, and blue means sad. so what 'roses are red, violets are blue' is really and truly saying - and you must all bow down and accept my absolute insight into this - is that 'love is bloody awful, and people with 'small things' are sad'. bet you never knew that's what it was really saying!"
236,1,a,"Hmmm, well then, God must be unrighteous since we ""evil atheists"" - and tons of other evil people - have not been eliminated.

239,1,a,Does that mean test tube babies are pure and sinless? If so then why don't we just eradicate that whole phase of passing through the birth canal (if that's what IS where we get our sinful nature) and just have test tube babies! Wheeeee!
240,1,a,"so much bs... where should i start? eugenics is about manipulating genomes of populations. since when are most abortions performed for the purpose of lowering or raising the frequency of certain alleles or traits in populations? if a woman wants to maximize her life, liberty, and happiness, and she feels that she can best do so by aborting a pregnancy, your intended prevention of that action 'flies in the face of the declaration of independence'... (not that the declaration has any legal standing.) whether an embryo or fetus is human is irrelevant. no thing, human or not, has the right to subsist completely on a human without the latter's consent. 'abortive technologies'? you sound like falwell, insisting that cloning destroys life when it does nothing of the sort. please explain your laughable statement."

281,1,a,that gives no evidence what soever to counter claim his statements he made. instead of lashing out like some self loathing playground bully you actually try for once.... how is he resisting the holy spirit? he is debating scripture in an open minded manner. perhaps seeking to find more truth than fallacy and see the heavy account of personal faith in believing. but no you wouldn't dare to think this would you? you'd rather just scream i'm right! like a ranting child with a tantrum than debate in a methodical manner.... you really bring out the worst in people mr. saint.....
282,1,a,"Then you should be able to post some numbers that show I am wrong. I had absolutely no problem whatsoever finding and posting numbers that show I am wrong.Whipping? Are you on crack, easy? You and your buddy have been completely smacked down here. You have spewed a bunch of rhetoric and BS and been repeatedly shut down with hard FACT.Why dont you go get a high school diploma so you can at least understand basic math...heck...for that matter, a grade school diploma would ensure you had all the math skills to understand how silly your position is in the face of the facts."
283,1,a,How many suicide bombers have you herard of wearing a cross? You're assertion is absurd...as usual.
284,1,a,"That is an interesting fact, how come I have never heard such a thing..maybe a link is in order and not a stormfront or the like link please....actually I have listened to gangsta rap...Easy E, Snoop, NWA, and so many others, in fact they are in my truck right now.. imagine a redhead ""whitey"" takes enjoyment in listening to all kinds of music.. hmm I also have Lady Smith Black Mambazo, Nat King Cole, and while we are at it I have music that I adore from Iran, Iraq, Saudi, Turkey and so many I cant list them all... whats your point?I would hardly call rap the decay of the 90's, apparently a lot of people listen if they are making money....I wonder if you have a crazy relative somewhere in your past? Maybe that would explain a lot."
285,1,a,"i'm back!! had to re-visit the real world. anyway, how is it that you say i'm confused about my sexuality, because i don't approve of gay marriage?! that is weak! people always claim things like that when they have nothing else to say. i'm straight as hell, and you really don't know me engough to say diffrently. but you on the other hand must be confused."
286,1,a,"this particular one, formulated the way it is, might well fail. that's why i hope the stupid attorney stops where he is.  where do you get this bizarre idea that the court shies away from 'controversial' issues? ooooo... that's a persuasive legal argument. i'm impressed (not). gay people have been 'earning it' for over 100 years. in the short-term, we may suffer setbacks, in the long-term, there's no stopping us. another unsubstantiated pov that also happens to be untrue. no matter how many times the ditto-heads on the right say it, it remains a fact that the state supreme courts that have recognized the right of same-sex to marry have been dominated by moderate and conservative, republican-appointed judges. of course, they're part of the fading breed of conservatives... the ones who believe in individual rights and freedom."
287,1,a,"is this the pro-sodomite woman talking here? where does it say in the bible that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy makes one feel squeaky clean like you claim to be?  where does jesus then say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. one more time now, preppy: where does jesus say that defending carnal iniquity and sodomy is something that he and god approve of? got a scripture where he says gay sex sin suddenly became a righteous endeavor? obviously you have created a carnal, iniquity-loving jesus that's different than the jesus of the bible. so go preach that trash to someone who's buying it."
288,1,a,query: why do they call the followers of gush limpbutt the addict 'dittoheads'? answer: they have no ideas of their own. think gush & cindy have the same supplier?  now there's a capitalist we all can admire!!
289,1,a,I am not making a mockery of the second ammendment (and so what if I am. Isn't free speech on the first ammendment?). I am actually asking a legitimate question and have yet to have it answered. WHERE DO WE DRAW THE LINE? The second ammendment sheds no light on this. If I was mocking anything it was that you were dodging the question because you want to say no limits although in face of something so obvious you are embarrassed at such a statement.
290,1,a,"honk! wrong. my parents inherited a house from their parents. they also inherited knowledge and were taught certain values. concepts stored in one brain, expressed via words and encoded in a new brain. epigenetic inheritance, yet still materialistic. doesn't mean they didn't also inherit a bunch of genes, and for the umpteenth time it doesn't mean they get to screw their face up like hiro and tweak them whenever they like. shouldn't i be asking you that, since that's what you say happens, despite having exactly zero evidence to back it up? honk! what a great big fat juicy lie, ss. don't put it in the keep net though; toss it back so you can use it again later."

When did your right to self-defense end at your property line?That is quite a stretch from an old bubble gum chewer even like yourself sliiiick.Thank G-d I live in Texas!!! Those facists states are already failed states so it is semantics anyway when the slaves get restless. criminals are a tyrants wanna be best friend.Everyone should know by now that the cops have no duty to defend anyone no matter the excuses...you are on your own. Everyday I read about the predator leos preying on the electorate so which is worse?"
293,1,a,"i'll agree with you on some of the things you said, but not the hired gun. america doesn't need to hire guns, we have our own. if what you are asserting is the case, then why would we be where we are right now. and are you saying that israel gets there weapons for free? this is america son, nothing is free if you haven't found out. and our strong ties with israel are more than likely due to the fact that they're more trustworthy than any of the arab nations, thus making a greater ally."
294,1,a,"I'm not big on the abortion issue, but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is sexist and arrogant? That's a tactic straight from the leftist playbook. Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents. Isn't it you who always accuses conservatives of being intolerant of people who think differently than them? Now that's irony!"
295,1,a,"Well, Jews have always been indecisive. Like this joke says:Q: How many Jews does it take to screw in a light bulb?A: 4; 1 to screw it in and 3 to argue about which way it turns."
296,1,a,"don't you insult african americans!  i have posted a number of times links and comments by prominant black leaders who infact do support gay marriage. when will you stop your 'don't insult african americans' lies when you know all too well just how wrong you actually are?  oh that's right...never, because you just don't care what anyone thinks if it at all differs from your opinion.  weren't you spanked enough in the 'banned people' forum?"
297,1,a,"So that's what, at least 4 lies in 8 days? Pretty impressive Archie. You should be on your knees asking god's forgiveness for your lies."
298,1,a,"so, clive, everyone that believes that god created the earth is an idiot? you need to spend some quality time with some that do and i think you'd change your tune."
299,1,a,"you mean pascals sucker bet? if arch is wrong, he's wasted a good portion of his life and income catering to a false priesthood, a tick suckling off the fat and meat and marrow of their 'flocks'. he's prevented himself from exploring the wonderful opprotunities this limited life has to offer for the nebulous promises that come after death is assured.  furthermore, he's extolling others to do so also. because misery needs company to justify itself and in insecurity over the rediculous beliefs they hold, they need numbers to validate their wastes and servitude."
300,1,a,"oh... isn't that just soooo bad??? i mean, after all, brown is such an erudite in this matter, isn't he? his words are just set in stone... he should have just attacked the church and opus dei more so more ignorant people could believe all the xxxx he wrote and be militant atheists without an agenda beyod that of attacking religion. what is it with you and the chuch? do you even know what opus dei is? do you know what it preaches? haven't you no argument that stands on its own, and doesn't need to be founded on some attack on christianity? defend something, don't just attack what you don't comprehend."

302,1,a,Then why does god order the killing of the unborn in the womb in Hosea 13:16.What did they ever do to god?Does god fear these people so much he has to have unborn members of their community killed. Un born members who couldn't have possibly done anything to god!
303,1,a,so your saying he was 200% god-man? i'm not a mathematician but that can't be right surley.

306,1,a,"and jyoshu is in full cheer-leader mode... what the heck did i supposedly back-peddle on? please. be explicit. no wait. you're not going to answer that, are you... roflmao! symbiote runs around proclaiming all sorts of things (falsely) as my supposed hypothesis, and you pretend that me refusing to take up her strawman approach is somehow 'back-peddling'? more like the blind leading the blind, walking in circles and thinking they are travelling quickly! as for proof, do you understand what 'hypothesis' means in the first place? look it up."
307,1,a,"what about god? so many god-fearing people, he must be a terrorist :) seriously i really don't know much about terrorists. i know that bin laden was behind 9/11 but he wasn't the only one, but that's about it."
308,1,a,"Atheism is a religion? Pray tell, where would I find the atheist church?Ridiculous."
309,1,a,depends on what you mean by 'history'.  did george washington really cut down the cherry tree? that is fiction. did george washington exist? that is documented.. and is history.
310,1,a,"be sure and count the number of hits vs. the number of misses of some well trained leos. sap, remember your postition you took now on citizens might miss and hit some innocent person? read 3 or 4 versions of this shootout and learn something! lots of useful information in there."
311,1,a,"Waxy, please read this. Maybe it will help you. When you said the proper way to say it was, ""....tell me I'm wrong, at least do it grammatically."" you made absolutely no sense. Do something grammatically? You obviously have to use grammar when you write a sentence."
312,1,a,"Now you're just being an butt. The word Dungarees is a coloquialism. Do you know what that word means? Also that's what jeans were called before the word ""jeans' entered the venacular. (Do you know what that word means?) So, now are you going to tell me that only homosexuals have larger vocabularies? Get a life...and preferably not mine...I'm living it at the moment."
313,1,a,"what? naaah,... all we have to do is deny the suspects are 'persons' then we can do any emoticonxcensored thing we want to with them and there's no moral aspects to it at all,... just like abortion and (at one time) slavery. one thing that has always puzzled me,... 'how is it that enemy combatants and convicted murderous terrorists can come away with more rights and sympathy from the left than a prebirth little human child can?' (scratching head) emoticonxconfused how is it that a leftist can see more outcries for humanity in a whale, dolphin, spotted owl or field mouse than they do in an actual prebirth human child? one of the great mysteries of the modern world, i suppose."
314,1,a,"Is your thinking really this simplistic? Either I have to agree with you or I am an anarchist? Is that all the complexity you can handle? This or that? Black or white? The best soda in the world is Sprite and everything else is wrong? What a boring little pigeon-holed world you live in.No harm no foul - that is where I stand on sex and romance. Kids, animals and those who don't or can't consent are off-limits. K? Now that I have established (AGAIN) how I feel on that matter, let me reinstate.Any God that allows love and intimacy for only a select group is viscious."
315,1,a,cant you read? if you are correct this actually supports my point.
316,1,a,"More chattering from the peanut gallery? Haven't gotten the memo, you're no longer a player? Honestly....clamoring for attention is so low budget. No shame."
317,1,a,"why would you think such an absurd concept. corporations don't cast a vote in an election do they? why not?  does a corporation have a mind of it's own that it may look to it's interests in it's attempts to influence legislation? no, it permits individuals to overcome finance laws and exercise greater influence than is normally permitted for an individual. should your car have rights? you pay a tax for it. how about your house? pay a tax for that also every year."

319,1,a,"that i later 'concede' in a pm? you mean despite the fact that probably coming up on a dozen times now i have told you premises represent evidence and you decided that the last time i told you this was a concession.... what do you think a 'logical premise' is? show me denying that i said a. i'll be honest i have no way to prove otherwise because proof relies on logic. of course there is an objective truth here, i can illustrate the contradiction inherent in false logic using the real world; but if you don't accept that contradiction is unacceptable...."

326,1,a,I have an entire New Testament. You've got what - a mouthful of denial? When you get to the level of the NT works let us know.
327,1,a,"and your kids go to private school yes? so you want higher teen pregnancy, more abortions and more sexually transmitted diseases?  if you are disagreeing with my statement that you want all of those lower, then you are admitting you either want them to increase or stay the same. as you have railed against abortion, it would appear you're being contradictory. make up your mind. and yet they have lower rates. funny how that works.  no. in the seven years since introduction 620,000 or so european women have used it. so that's around 88,000 abortions a year. 1.2 million happen in the us annually. as the population of europe is around the same as the us, it's not a valid point. 88k to 1.2 million is nothing.  plan b isn't abortion. try me."

329,1,a,"uhm, you do realize that humans and chimps are not the same things as dogs, cats, horses, and sharks ... right?  i am under no obligation to address the evolutionary origin every possible organism. let's review the facts. 1) i said there is a ton of evidence for macroevolution, and there is.  2) i gave a specific example, saying that i could provide multipe lines of independent evidence supporting the fact that humans and chipms share a common evolutionary ancestor. and i can."
330,1,a,"parents want convenience and to pacify their children with a 'happy meal'. most kids don't ask for lettuce, they ask for burgers. wonder why mcdonalds doesn't add a soy burger to their menu? they have salads and adding soy products would be another way to show they 'care' about health. the answer might be they have done consumer research and found the costs to create/market a new soy product outweight the profits."
331,1,a,"so what is it that isn't true? are you saying nasa didn't spend 12 billion dollars developing a zero gravity pen or that russia didn't use a pencil? and since you're so anal about a simple joke, go ahead and support your claim that anything my joke says isn't true, with actual evidence. your opinion doesn't carry much weight with me."

344,1,a,1) why is the philosophy of jefferson twisted?? if you can't say its because you are a typical anti american liberal. 2) nothing to suppoprt it? if anti-american liberal positions were made illegal as per the constitution then everyone would have to vote among the conservatives.  the political spectrum would simple shift so that both extremes were in the intelligent range. on the far left you'd have romney and on the far right you'd have ron paul. now that would be an intelligent election consistent with our very very conservative constitution.
345,1,a,but they lack evidence as to why a first trimester fetus should be considered a 'being'. they want to change the law based on metaphysical claims attached to their religion. why don't we make it illegal to work on sunday while we're at it. and why not saturday too? and enough with the bacon already (just for good measure).

349,1,a,"sure. god commanded faithfulness in marriage. yet he never even raised an eyebrow at abraham inpregnating his maid, and went on to bestow blessings on him like it never happened. god commanded you should not steal. yet moses' brilliant idea of having the israelites borrow gold and jewelry from the egyptians they knew they never were going to repay seemed mildly humorous to god at the time. god commanded that noone should make graven images of him or anything in heaven. so what's the deal with the ark of the covenant? and the number of instances god commanded his people to kill, shortly after commanding them not to kill, well this could become a pretty long post.  i know you asked for one, but i just started rambling because so many came to mind. pick one if you want."

They invented things like Midol for moods like yours.Just because someone doesn't agree with you doesn't make them stupid, or misguided, or immoral, or dishonest, or any of the other snipes you've been firing off. Lol, and you're telling me to not throw any hissy fits."
367,1,a,poet i found it interesting your illutration of the 'matirx' series. i too have seen the two episodes and found it filled with religious overtones. i dont know the faith of the wachaski brothers but there story is intreging. all mankind decived by this lifstyle which as seen from reality is merely a save to produce power. much like mankind is decived by satan today. a select group of people who believe that a savior wil come to free man kind from this savery. even those who have seen the truth and reject it. this sounds alot like the account of the bible. i want so much to see the final episode to find if the theme continues. will neo's death be that which saves all mankind? we will wait and see.

378,1,a,"ok, fine, you can use that line, but there is also a moajority that believes in other things. there's this crazy thing, called a choice. we all have that. remember? i made the choice to have sex, you're making the choice to be a total ***hole. we all make a decision, and its the strong ones that stick with them, even though there are others who dont believe the same thing."
379,1,a,"Stalin died of natural causes while in power, I believe. Perhaps the fall of communism is due in part that the purges stopped. So, killing hundreds of thousands of people was wise for Stalin, huh? Good. Good. Anybody disagree with canadianman76?"
380,1,a,"you're right justine. organized religion has always been used by some people as crutch in order to feel superior to others. why use your brain and heart if you don't have to? because they are encouraged by their particular religion to behave this way, they think it's 'morally' alright. 'sickening' is a good way to put it."
381,1,a,"no reply bassman? seriously mate, i can understand why some people on this forum have a problem with you, you can't just go around posting total lies! you are a sensible guy, for the most part, lets have some reasonable arguments as oppose to mindless bigotry."

384,1,a,"Okay, so if we only need 10 laws then they must be, without any doubt, the 10 most important rules possible that would serve mankind throughout history. Not coveting your neighbor's oxen made the list? Why is not creating any graven images more important than not enslaving people? That didn't even make the list. If those 10 things were all that God intended to impart on mankind I have to question his mental competance."
385,1,a,"could it be that they've finally realized that there is no viable argument for gun control in a country that was built on freedom to bear arms? each time the control-lobby comes up with an argument....they get shot to pieces. (laugh out loud!) it is interesting to note that both of the democratic front-runners for 2008 favor gun control. with the recent death of charlton heston, there's a weakness in the armor of the nra. i would go on a handgun buying spree, but i already have enough guns and ammo to stave off a thousand or so government guntakers at a place we call 'the little alamo'."

388,1,a,"Lemme guess, in real life you're a lawyer, correct? You must be because you're extremely hypertechnical to the point of absurdity. It doesn't matter what you call them, be it criminal or gang member of dope dealer or home invader, if somebody breaks the law then they're a criminal and it's as simple as that.Seriously dude, you're trying to get off on a technicality here. Like a lawyer trying to argue ""Your honor my client isn't a prostitute, she's a female escort"". Doesn't matter what you call it or what you try to pass it off as, a criminal is a criminal regardless of what their formal title is.So which is Ripskar, do criminals have guns and are likely to shoot you in the face and kill you, or do they not have guns at all. It's one or the other, it can't be both."

Midgets like you got to have some backup.How and why do you always change the subject? Can't take the heat? Do you ever read headers?You got a mouth on you as big as grand canyon.
393,1,a,"'blah blah blah'? look, you weighed in here on what i said, making an issue of whether it was internal, empatically making a point that it was action. as i said, i'm basically agreeing with you on the whole thing here about there needing to be equality in this situation, so i don't know why you're being so eager to find something to disagree over here."
394,1,a,"I'm going to ask you a direct question, which I am sure you will ignore.John is an atheist.He has stolen some money.

398,1,a,a double helping of insulting spam? i'm honoured....emoticonxgood how interesting that you selectively belittle crick's comments on panspermia while lauding his debunked tornado in a junkyard conjecture.
399,1,a,"another question that shouild be answered is . . . if the bible says that noah and a few members of his family were the only ones to survive this 'global' flood, how come there are so many other accounts of others surviving a flood? did god miss the target (that being the whole of humanity)? genesis 6:13 (new international version) 13 so god said to noah, 'i am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. i am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. presumably he also knew from the beginning of time that he was going to make this great big ####-up. how embarrassing!"
400,1,a,"Calling someone a ""liar"", ""fool hardy"", ""[corrupter] of the truth"", and unobjective is considered complimentary where you come from? Odd, but OK, I'll go with it you lying brainwashed fool (hey, this is fun! I like using Archie's compliments!).Actually, my ""sick hypothetical"" was a very valid question. I simply asked you if god commanded you to kill your neighbour for his sins, sins which you had no evidence of, would you do it. It seems like a fairly simple, straightforward question to me. Why not answer it?I see a pattern here Archie. If someone asks you a tough question about your faith, you cry ""Corrupter! Blasphemer!"" and run away. Is this your idea of ""witnessing""? Is your faith that weak? Answer my simple little question, then I will answer the same one, or another of your choosing if you'd like. Tit for tat."

404,1,a,"So you think it is a good idea for public schools to assume the role of parents? Perhaps you would support a balance then. Given what you say here, you wouldn't think it a bad idea for the New Hampshire School System to take a field trip to the local Catholic church would you? You know, so kids can know what resources, agencies, and organizations are available to them in the event that they may need to interact with them in the future.The School Board apparently gets the message, however. According to the article, it has instructed school administrators to investigate the matter, and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary. I would think it is."

410,1,a,oh? what keeps you from having 6 or eight or for that matter having crossed bandoleers across the chest? i suspect kalifornia law will be changed a bunch and one in the pipe will be in vogue as well as a loaded mag in the gun for utility sake. you wouldn't want the perp to be disadvantaged too much now would you? how many shots must one allow the perp before you can fire back?
411,1,a,"so now name calling and accusations as to my mental health are what you concider as rational thought?  i expect that you must be some sort of expert on warfare, in paticular this war? am i to believe that you are a soldier there now?  your rage towards me in your post only shows just how easily upset you are. i posted exactly what i meant to and you went off on a tangent. i asked you for proof and all you can do is a schoolyard tactic if 'show me yours before i show mine?' pitiful."

413,1,a,"hey, archangel, i notice you didn't respond to the points i made - no argument, huh? to quote jyoshu: 'well since you didn't address my points, i'll assume you're done! a simple 'ok, i concede that ... and moving on back to the issues ...' ***jyoshu well, everyone, looks like our ez/ss clone has finally realized his argument was wrong."
414,1,a,"yeah, you are right dono.....so explain to me about the constitution??? would you like to start with the federalist papers and move on from there? i have yet to hear someone prove me wrong on the constitution. if you think that the cruel and unusual term doesn't apply to the living constitution then you are sadly mistaken. how do you think it became that the death penalty for minors is illegal now? the court 15yrs ago said differently!!! how can the inerpretation change with no basis other then ones own personal opinion? this is scary..people, you gotta think this stuff through!"
415,1,a,"but wouldnt it mean that if she (if phunting is female) burns in hell, that would mean that god really exists. do you believe in god? also, do you think that if god really does exists that he's just bluffing about that hell stuff? hmmmm..."

418,1,a,"or get a hybrid. or carpool.  but it is quite impossible to reason financially with one who holds the most idiotic of fisical ideas.  it still amuses me that vor thinks a cd during low inflation is a good idea. hey, why is it that vor has cowardly fled from virtually every argument i met him in? btw vor, everytime you say something that is just financially idiotic, i'm going to bring up the cd comment."
419,1,a,"You mean to tell me that you would deny a woman's right to her own body for a zygote, yet you have no problem murdering real human beings? Sounds like a conservative to me..."
420,1,a,"and mythology. you forgot mythology. for example, the two stories of creation were probably two popular folk myths. and the story of the flood is actually two versions of the myth that are intermixed. and, of course, the stories of job and of jonah are pure mythology. do you know what logic is? comparing the moral mythology of noah to a parable is an analogy, not logic. the myths of noah are not history. and since we are talking about noah, i see you bailed on the thread where the pyramids of egypt were being discussed. and yet you refer to this obvious myth as history."
421,1,a,"like i said in another thread, the argument i hear most often from so-called 'pro-choicers' is that you cannot legislate morality. well then what can you legislate? every law in existence is legislation of morality! by that way of thinking, then we should have no laws. if someone kidnaps and murders your 3-year-old child, then let's hope the murderer goes free because we cannot legislate morality!"
422,1,a,"are you illiterate or just stupid? when you try to use biblical passages dishonestly and out of context in order to convince people that god would favor an economy without social programs when, in fact, the exact opposite is clearly true, then you have perverted the word of god in the service of selfishness and greed. this aint hard."
423,1,a,"so have the trillions of dollars that have already been 'redistributed upward' since the reagan/gramm deregulation mania helped end poverty? or has it created a dependent class of ultra rich people unable to function without a taxpayer bailout? that sword, my shonda friend, cuts both ways."
424,1,a,"shall we regress to babble?  the government is already heavily into the term 'marriage'. not only the us government, but governments all over the world refer to 'marriage' as the legal union of a man and a woman. changing the definition in one country would likely create confusion everywhere.  what if some countries required you to clarify whether you were married to a man or a woman in order to get a visa? do we need to define several types or classes of 'married couple'. what if some countries objecting to the concealment of the gender of one's spouse instituted a death penalty for it? i would argue that legally joined same-sex couples should have all the benefits and rights afforded married couples, but not for redefining 'marriage' solely for the purpose of calling them such."
425,1,a,"are you one of the hard of understanding people? flyboy got it, even if his rationalisations were insufficient. even so, they were far superior to much of the dross you regurgitate."
426,1,a,"Spanking doesn't teach children to defend themselves against violence. It teaches them the exact opposite because they are forced to submit to these acts of violence *and* they are told it's being done out of love. Do you ever wonder what conditions some women and men to accept violence from their partner? Do you ever wonder how they could not recognize it as abuse? I'll give you three guesses. Different personalites process and categorize information in different ways. Unfortunately for many children, this is one of them. :( And unfortunately I'm speaking from experience."
427,1,a,and i am a clump of human cell with shoes on...what is your point? no. you seem to refuse the idea that 'human' as a noun is used to describe a human being meaning the entity as a whole and not the individual cells that make it up. i am sorry you don't understand this but the word means what it means. i find it odd that you even care what you call a fetus anyway. your sperm is a human now? you should invest in a biology book.
428,1,a,to take the pis out on others? seems like the thing to do. if you're here to learn...consider your teachers... there are more effective means of acquiring knowledge and insight than to sit around and gab with your mentally defective peers.
429,1,a,"making sweeping judgments against homosexuals and atheists, with no real knowledge of their situation? archie has no problem. but when it comes to christianity, the obfuscational ploy of 'i don't know all the details' comes out, followed promptly by a thorough lack of concern for finding out any additional details. she is blatantly violating her religion in doing so. the bible lays out exclusive reasons for 'divorce'. this isn't one of them. this is yet another example of religious intolerance, even to the extent of violating their own religion."
430,1,a,"You assume homosexuality is a ""choice"", with no evidence substantiating that position, until you have been shown evidence that it is genetic???And you claim to be a ""scientist by profession""???LOLOLOLOL!While you're at it, maybe you can explain to us what a ""unconscious choice"" is..."

433,1,a,"they weren't interested, remember? so your god punishes children for not being a member of the right 'club'. your god sounds more and more like a monster every time you mention him. once again, like with archie i have been wrong to assume you a bigot, you're a xenophobe."
434,1,a,What about people who believe in something so much they are willing to suffer - even die - for it? I thought you Christians were really into that kind of thing! emoticonXAngel I ask because the history of the Documentary Hypothesis is filled with those who were persecuted for daring to suggest that evidence led away from the tradition that Moses had written the entire Pentateuch.

I'm not talking about my rifle, I'll be glad to keep my free government rifle clean. How about you?"
437,1,a,"none of them which are correct.  how about you address my points? oh wait, you won't because you need to maintain your fantasy land where everyone who disagrees with you is an atheist.  how can you attack me when you won't even read the links given to you?"

443,1,a,"what are you? nuts? you know that in our 'gun free' society, you are more likely to be a victim of violent crime, armed robbery or homicide than you were before the howard government tightened the gun laws? i mean, you know we are less safe now, right? but hey, at least we can rest easy knowing people are only be being bashed and stabbed to death, rather than shot. god bless australia, huh?"

448,1,a,So your claim that no pre-existing belief is necessary is untested by you. Do you have an example of an actual non-believer having a religious experience that made a believer of them? In my experience God never appears to atheists. Funny that.

457,1,a,"but to some it is the word of their god. you see? you have no god so you dont have to worry (at least not yet). and 'divine', so you are saying besides sarcastic rhetoric that they were divinely inspired cause you labled them that. sears is now jcpenney's get with the times. and no it wouldnt be hung there cause you can tbuy drapes in revelation. fiction: archaeologival evidence is fiction? sick: yes soddom and ghamorah was a sad story. dangerous: yes to those who feel their sins bearing down on them. virulent manual for the self-destruction of the human race: history, salvation, truth. or is fiction today's word on sesame street?"
458,1,a,is that the best you can do simone? i think the games up for you old girl! i used to do volunteer work for the samaritans in england and we had a few callers like you. it sometimes takes a while to suss out a fantasist but you do eventually!
459,1,a,"Did you slip in it AGAIN? Were you led astray by a passage from Heller you thought you could use to legitimize gun control, your wet dream?I submit from many past rulings of the courts that little statement is in error."
460,1,a,"i don't see why not. if somebody is perfectly willing to murder you in cold blood despite your blind compliance i see no reason to believe that they'd hesitate if it meant crushing a skull with a bat rather than just shooting them in the face. seriously, what kind of stability are you dealing with when all it takes to motivate someone to murder is a simple question? a baseball bat isn't concealable like a handgun, is it? nor can it be readily used by someone suffering arthritis or used in a cramped location. any weapon can be used to inflict death and murder. the human body is hardly a modern marvel of resiliency and near-indestructibility. even sneezing wrong can be potentially fatal. certainly not. do you see a contradiction?"
461,1,a,"Obviously, in the event of a disaster, George W. Bush sure thinks he has a right to choose.Hmmm, let's see, should I interrupt my vacation just because people are drowning in New Orleans? Naw, I don't think I should. They're just poor people and they probably didn't vote for me."
462,1,a,"<flush>Just come up with something that discredits the resurrection, if you think you can. Should be easy for you Einsteins, shouldn't it?But in two years I haven't seen it yet. Not from you or anybody else.Where's the beef?"
463,1,a,That's an out that's peculiar to Christians. Good? Godidit. Bad? Devil's work.
464,1,a,that's pretty damn funny comming from you. if i am wrong why do you have countless threads that have been abandoned after you encountered people who refuted you? i don't play shotgun with frauds. look up gulliable in the dictionary. http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/ch/ch710_1.html try again. basilio uchuya and his wife admit to drawing them to sell to tourists based on comic books. you fell for a tourists scheme! how amusing.
465,1,a,"Now I read this and thought there are two ways I could describe you:1) You are very poorly read in history.or2) Why don't you give a damn about the born? at what point does that defenseless little child become second in your concerns to the unborn?I'm intrigued, I really am."
466,1,a,"d'ya think i should? make a mel gibson film and suddenly everyone's an expert eh? well despite what his gibson-ness would have us believe, gallipoli was a case of bad luck, incompetence and generals f*cking everyone over regardless of nationality. remember we lost huge numbers of british troops too. now i don't downplay the role of the anzacs, or their losses. but this was at a time when the british considered australians to be one and the same as themselves. there was hardly the conscious effort to use the anzacs as fodder over the tommies. gallipoli was a blunder (though again not as big a blunder as populist history has us believe) for everyone, regardless of nationality. there was certainly no sinister us and them between our nations- we were essentially considered as one."
467,1,a,bwhahaaa....this is unreal. precrime? seriously? minority report? and guns magically turn people into 'bad guys'? hum...good to know. and its funny: we will remove the temptation of a lethal weapon by enforcing new laws via our own lethal weapons.  you people are freaking retarded.
468,1,a,"as steve martin once said, 'well, ecuuuuuuse meeeee'. no polar icecaps today? ok what is the proper - pc terminology - that refers to the big chunk of ice, what sits over the top of the north and south regions of the planet? as long as it is not too long of a description or too lame - i can evolve to the next phase and say ...(thus and such)... instead. :) btw. iam sure that algore can remember the meaning of - 'polar icecaps'. sorry that, you can not."
